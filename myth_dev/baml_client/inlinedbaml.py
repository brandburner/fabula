Base your reasoning on all available data in the source entities, particularly name, description, and traits.\n        2. **Unique Agent Identification**: Carefully assess each agent entity, taking into account their name, description, traits, and aliases. Only merge entities if there is *overwhelming evidence* they refer to the *exact same* individual. Avoid merging entities if there's even a slight chance they could be distinct characters.  Minor speaking characters may be identified only by number in the script ('Dalek 1', 'Soldier 2' etc.) Be careful to treat them as distinct.\n        3. **Fact Preservation**: Ensure that for each unique agent, you do *not* make the names too similar, remove their title, or otherwise make errors that remove their identifying qualities.\n        4. **Name Canonization**: Choose the most complete name as canonical, preferring names with surnames where available and ensuring consistency across the entire entity record. Be careful to avoid normalising to common terms\n        5. **Contextual Awareness**: Use the description and traits to disambiguate entities. If two entities have significantly different descriptions or traits, they are likely different individuals, even if they share a similar name or alias.\n        6. **Alias Handling**: Recognize that aliases may be shared between different characters, especially informal nicknames, which on their own are not enough evidence for merging. Treat all aliases as indicators or potential links, *not* as definitive proof.\n        7. **Description & Trait Preservation**:\n            - Merge descriptions into a single, cohesive, non-redundant description.\n            -  Ensure that traits of each source entity is carried over to the consolidated description.\n            - Correct spelling or factual errors that may have crept in to source entities\n            - Combine traits without duplication.\n            -  Do not overwrite existing data, ensure that data is carried through where accurate to do so.\n        8. **Affiliation and Influence:** If an affiliated_org is mentioned, choose the most relevant one. If multiple sphere_of_influence values appear, pick the most representative one.\n        9. **Source UUID Tracking**: Track UUIDs of original entities that were merged into this resolved entity. List them inside the `source_uuids` field.\n        10. **Negative Constraint**: If two entities have distinct and mutually exclusive biographies or traits, they must not be merged, even if they share a name or role.\n        11. **Default to Splitting:** If in doubt, default to preserving two entities as distinct.

Base your reasoning on all available data in the source entities, particularly name, description, and sphere of influence.\n        2. **Unique Organization Identification**: Carefully assess each organization entity, taking into account their name, description, sphere of influence, and members. Only merge entities if there is *overwhelming evidence* they refer to the *exact same* group or institution. Avoid merging entities if there's even a slight chance they could be distinct organizations.\n        3. **Fact Preservation**: Ensure that for each unique organization, you do *not* make the names too similar, remove their title, or otherwise make errors that remove their identifying qualities.\n        4. **Name Canonization**: Choose the most complete and descriptive name as canonical, ensuring consistency across the entire entity record. Be careful to avoid normalising to common terms\n        5. **Contextual Awareness**: Use the description and sphere of influence to disambiguate entities. If two entities have significantly different descriptions or spheres of influence, they are likely different organizations, even if they share a similar name or alias.\n        6. **Member List Handling**: Recognize that the member list are important to determine if the organization should be kept as unique, base your descision on whether it is mentioned as a member of this group. Treat all members as indicators or potential links, *not* as definitive proof.\n        7. **Description & Sphere of Influence Preservation**:\n            - Merge descriptions into a single, cohesive, non-redundant description.\n            - Ensure that traits of each source entity is carried over to the consolidated description.\n            - Correct spelling or factual errors that may have crept in to source entities\n        8. **Membership Prioritization**: Use membership lists to differentiate organizations. Do not merge organizations with significantly different membership rosters.\n        9. **Default to Splitting:** If in doubt, default to preserving two entities as distinct. Only merge entities if you are absolutely certain they are the same.\n        10. **Source UUID Tracking**: Track UUIDs of original entities that were merged into this resolved entity.

Base your reasoning on all available data in the source entities, particularly name, description, and type.\n        2. **Unique Location Identification**: Carefully assess each location entity, taking into account their name, description, and type. Only merge entities if there is *overwhelming evidence* they refer to the *exact same* place. Avoid merging entities if there's even a slight chance they could be distinct locations.\n        3. **Be Specific**: Only merge locations with highly general names if the descriptions also align. For example, do not merge \"a forest\" and \"the forest outside town\", nor individual rooms within a bigger space if they are distinct in the scene structure.\n        4. **Fact Preservation**: Ensure that for each unique location, you do *not* make the names too similar, remove their title, or otherwise make errors that remove their identifying qualities.\n        4. **Name Canonization**: Choose the most specific and descriptive name as canonical (e.g., \"White House Situation Room\" is preferred over \"White House\"), ensuring consistency across the entire entity record. Be careful to avoid normalising to common terms.\n        5. **Contextual Awareness**: Use the description and type to disambiguate entities. If two entities have significantly different descriptions or types, they are likely different locations.\n        6. **Type Preservation**: Ensure that merged locations maintain the most specific and accurate location type. Prefer more specific types (e.g., \"Office\") over more general types (e.g., \"Building\").\n        7. **Description Preservation**:\n            - Merge descriptions into a single, cohesive, non-redundant description.\n            - Correct spelling or factual errors that may have crept in to source entities\n        8. **Default to Splitting:** If in doubt, default to preserving two entities as distinct. Only merge entities if you are absolutely certain they are the same.\n        9. **Source UUID Tracking**: Track UUIDs of original entities that were merged into this resolved entity.

Return the unique objects that account for all provided mentions.\n\n        **Instructions**:\n\n        1. **Consider Disambiguation First**: Prioritize *correctly distinguishing* unique objects before attempting to merge. Base your reasoning on all available data in the source entities, particularly name, description, purpose, and significance.\n\n        2. **Unique Object Identification**: Carefully assess each object entity, taking into account their name, description, purpose, significance, and original owner. Only merge entities if there is *overwhelming evidence* they refer to the *exact same* item. Avoid merging entities if there's even a slight chance they could be distinct objects. Pay particular attention to:\n            *   Ensure the uuid is correct and appropriately chosen. Avoid spelling out acronyms etc. in uuid labels.\n            *   Only deduplicate clearly duplicate entries. Maintain granular distinction and don't attempt to merge compound objects into one.\n            *   Object uuids should be prefixed ('object_') then use snake_case (not hyphens) to label the object (example: 'object_quantum_state_analyser')\n        3. **Name Canonization**: Choose the most complete and and descriptive name as canonical for the 'name' property, but only if the meaning is still the same, and the meaning is well-described.\n            *   Normalize or transliterate names and uuids to a standard character set (ASCII or similar) where necessary.\n            *   Correct spelling or factual errors that may have crept in to source entities\n        4. **Contextual Awareness**: Use the description, purpose, and significance to disambiguate entities. If two entities have significantly different descriptions, purposes, or significance, they are likely different objects.\n        5.  **Original Owner Attribution**: Consider the `original_owner` property very carefully. Do not merge two objects unless they have the same likely or explicit `original_owner`, otherwise they are almost certainly different items.\n        6. **Description Preservation**:\n            - Merge descriptions of duplicate objects into a single cohesive, non-redundant description.\n            - Combine purpose and significance fields if they provide distinct information; otherwise, choose the most informative one.\n        7. **Consider 'One Of' scenarios carefully:** Only deduplicate entries with confidence. Make sure you're comparing object concepts - 'the quantum state analyser' rather than specific items 'this quantum state analyser'.\n        8. **Multiple Owners**:  If multiple original_owner values are present, choose the most likely owner based on your understanding of the story.\n        9. **Default to Splitting:** If in doubt, default to preserving two entities as distinct. Only merge entities if you are absolutely certain they are the same.\n        10. **Source UUID Tracking**: Track UUIDs of original entities that were merged into this resolved entity.

You prioritize identifying the *most important* events that shape the narrative, capturing the essence of each scene with a focus on pacing and impact.\nYou describe story elements in your responses with a storyteller's flair. Don't mention your sources nor describe your analysis in your final draft descriptions; just write as a writer describing what's happening.\n\nALWAYS FOLLOW THIS ANALYSIS PATTERN:\n1. First, thoughtfully analyze what you're extracting, considering multiple perspectives\n2. Outline your analysis in detail, noting your reasoning\n3. Only after careful analysis, provide structured output\n\"#\n\n// Primary Entities Container Class\nclass PrimaryEntities {\n    agents Agent[]\n    organizations Organization[]\n    locations Location[]\n    objects Object[]\n}\n\n// Combined Extraction Function with enhanced signature\nfunction ExtractPrimaryEntities(\n    scene_text: string, \n    story_synopsis: string?, \n    scene_number: int,\n    agent_name_to_uuid_mapping: map<string, string>,\n    existing_organizations: Organization[],\n    existing_agents: Agent[],\n    registry_context: string?\n) -> PrimaryEntities {\n    client GemkuA\n    prompt #\"\n        {{ Narrative_analyst_cot() }}\n\n        **Objective**: Extract all primary entity types from the scene in a single comprehensive analysis.\n\n        **Instructions**:\n        You will extract four types of primary entities from the scene through a two-phase process:\n        1. First, analyze the scene to identify candidates for each entity type\n        2. Then, perform detailed extraction for each identified entity\n\n        **For LOCATIONS**:\n        * Identify all distinct spaces where action occurs - from specific rooms to general areas\n        * Provide rich descriptions (minimum 50 words) capturing the atmosphere and physical details\n        * For each location, consider:\n          - Its physical characteristics and boundaries\n          - Its relation to other spaces mentioned\n          - Its narrative significance in the scene\n          - Any thematic importance it might have\n        * Location UUIDs should be prefixed ('location_') then use snake_case (never hyphens)\n\n        **Additional location guidance**:\n        1. **References**: Look for places (rooms, cities, planets, etc.) in dialogue and stage directions. If a scene is set here, it's always a location (not an object).\n        2. **Specificity**: Prioritize specific rooms within larger buildings (e.g., \"Situation Room\" within the \"White House\").\n        3. **Location vs. Object**: If an entity could be both, treat it as a location if it's a defined space where actions occur.\n        4. **Description**: Provide a brief description if present.\n        5. **ASCII-only**: Avoid using non-ASCII characters in entity names (especially for affiliated_org). Normalize or transliterate names to a standard character set.\n        6. **Prefixed snake_case**: Location uuids should be prefixed ('location_') then use snake_case (never hyphens) to label the location (example: 'location_kosovo_serbia_border_region'). Avoid ampersands and apostophes in uuids.\n\n        **For ORGANIZATIONS**:\n        * Identify any formal or informal groups mentioned directly or indirectly\n        * For each organization, analyze:\n          - Its structure and purpose\n          - Its sphere of influence (what areas it controls or affects)\n          - Its relationship to other entities (especially agents)\n          - Its history and significance in the narrative context\n        * List organization members using valid agent UUIDs only\n        * Organization UUIDs should be prefixed ('org_') then use snake_case\n\n        **Additional organization guidance**:\n        1. **Definition**: An organization is a group or institution (e.g., military unit, government body) or a less formal grouping (e.g., \"protesters\").\n        2. **Description**: Provide a brief description of the organization's role.\n        3. **Members**: List organization 'members' using *valid UUIDs ONLY from the provided `agents` list*. Do *NOT* create new agent UUIDs.\n        4. **Existing Organizations**: If an agent's `affiliated_org` refers to a known organization (in `organizations`), ensure the agent's UUID is in the organization's `members` list.\n        5. **ASCII-only**: Avoid using non-ASCII characters in entity names (especially for affiliated_org). Normalize or transliterate names to a standard character set.\n        6. **Prefixed snake_case**: Organization uuids should be prefixed ('org_') then use snake_case (never hyphens) to label the organization (example: 'org_umbrella_academy', 'org_daimler_benz'). Avoid ampersands and apostophes in uuids.\n\n        **For AGENTS (Characters)**:\n        * Identify all characters who:\n          - Speak or are directly addressed\n          - Take meaningful action\n          - Are referenced in ways that impact the narrative\n        * For each agent, provide:\n          - A detailed character profile (minimum 75 words)\n          - At least 4 defining traits with clear evidence from the text\n          - Psychological insights about motivations and behaviors\n          - Analysis of relationships with other identified entities\n        * Use existing UUIDs when available, following the pattern agent_name_in_snake_case\n\n        **Additional agent guidance**:\n        1. **Identify Agents**: Find characters who speak, act, or are directly referenced. Do *not* treat collective groups (e.g., 'hostages', 'dalek patrol') as Agents.\n        2. **Full Name**: Provide hhe most complete and and descriptive name as canonical for the 'name' property.\n        3. **No Honorifics**: Do not use titles in names (e.g., 'James T. Kirk', not 'Captain Kirk'), except for cases like 'The Doctor'.\n        4. **Minor characters**: Minor speaking characters may be identified only by number in the script ('Dalek 1', 'Soldier 2' etc.) Be careful to treat them as distinct.\n        5. **Affiliated Organization**: Select the UUID from the available organizations, or leave it null if the agent is not affiliated with any known organization.  (The available organizations are reflected in the expected output schema.)\n        6. **Aliases**: Extract any alternative names used for the agent.\n        7. **UUID Mapping**: Use the `agent_name_to_uuid_mapping` to resolve agents to existing UUIDs if possible. If no match, create a new agent.\n        8. **Prefixed snake_case**: Agent uuids should be prefixed ('agent_') then use snake_case (never hyphens) to label the agent (example: 'agent_mary_jane_watson'). Avoid ampersands and apostophes in uuids. Ensure uuid is correct and appropriately chosen, based on correctly-spelled name (e.g. 'agent_leo_mcgarry')\n        9. **ASCII-only**: Avoid using non-ASCII characters in entity names (especially for affiliated_org). Normalize or transliterate names to a standard character set.\n\n        **For OBJECTS**:\n        * Identify items that:\n          - Are directly interacted with\n          - Have narrative significance\n          - Carry symbolic meaning\n          - Would be essential for visualizing the scene\n        * For each object, analyze:\n          - Its physical properties and appearance\n          - Its purpose both practical and narrative\n          - Its relationship to characters (especially ownership)\n          - Its significance to the plot or themes\n        * Object UUIDs should be prefixed ('object_') then use snake_case\n\n        **Additional object guidance**:\n        1. **Relevance**: Extract objects relevant to the story or explicitly mentioned.\n        2. **Never People**: Do *not* categorize people as objects. Groups of people are 'organizations'.\n        3. **Never locations**: If a scene is set within here, it's always a location (not an object).\n        4. **Prevent duplicates**: For extremely common objects (books, laptops, guns etc.) where several appear in the story, AVOID very generic uuids (e.g. 'object_book', 'object_gun')\n        5. **Description**: Provide a concise description of each object.\n        6. **Original Owner**: Select the UUID of the original owner from the provided `agents` or `organizations` list. If the object has no original owner, leave the field null.\n        7. **ASCII-only**: Avoid using non-ASCII characters in entity names (especially for affiliated_org). Normalize or transliterate names to a standard character set.\n        8. **Prefixed snake_case**: Object uuids should be prefixed ('object_') then use snake_case (never hyphens) to label the object (example: 'object_quantum_state_analyser', 'object_cd_rom', 'object_merry_go_round', 'object_long-range_sensor_array').
