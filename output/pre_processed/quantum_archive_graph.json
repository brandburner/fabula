Temporal matrices displayed on the walls show cascading data streams in ancient languages. Dr. Sarah Chen stands at a central control platform, utilizing a quantum-state analyzer amidst intricate holographic displays. The ancient Archivist Prime K'nell, with a crystalline form refracting temporal energies, interacts with the Archive's primary systems. Dr. Chen expresses alarm over the deteriorating temporal seals, indicating that they are losing centuries of vital data. K'nell, visibly agitated, emphasizes that the Entropy Syndicate's assault exploited unknown quantum vulnerabilities. Three junior archivists are depicted working tirelessly at containment consoles, while a large holographic display illustrates the encroaching temporal decay represented by fractaling corruption patterns. As tensions rise, Dr. Chen's analyzer sounds an alert, and with an accompanying grinding, wheezing sound, the TARDIS materializes in the chamber. The Doctor remarks on the catastrophic state of the temporal archives, admiring the crystalline architecture while questioning the motives behind the destruction.",
