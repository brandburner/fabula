The Doctor reveals that the Entropy Syndicate will now face the judgment of the awakened time.  The Syndicate operatives freeze in temporal stasis, timelines collapsing; Voss is trapped in a causality loop. Malik, shocked by the unforeseen consequence of their actions, expresses disbelief at their failed calculations. The Doctor emphasizes that time is not a solvable equation, but a living entity now made aware thanks to Malik's actions.",
