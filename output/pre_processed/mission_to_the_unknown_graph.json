Lowery expresses frustration over their precarious situation, while Cory urges him to focus on the repairs.

The Supreme demands reports regarding the status of their operations. Dalek 1 informs the Supreme that emissaries from seven planets are on schedule and will arrive as planned. The Supreme, looming with authority, states that the conference will commence at first sun. Proceeding to security matters, Dalek 2 reports that an alien spacecraft has been located and they are close to reaching it. The Supreme's demeanor darkens as it commands that the ship and its occupants must be 'totally destroyed', emphasizing the order with repeated 'Destroyed!' commands, affirming the ruthlessness of their mission.

His horror grows as he discovers his forearm covered with the white spines of the Varga. As Cory returns, he informs Lowery of a Dalek city nearby, from which he overheard plans for galactic destruction. Overwhelmed by the effects of the Varga poison, Lowery succumbs to madness, repeatedly chanting 'Kill.' Cory reacts swiftly, shooting Lowery to protect himself and then begins recording a desperate warning about the impending Dalek invasion aimed at the galaxy. Meanwhile, two Daleks analyze seismic readings in the jungle, noting the presence of the crew from the rocket ship and concluding that they must be exterminated. Unbeknownst to Cory, the Daleks are closing in. As he continues his recording, the Daleks later confirm that he is dead, ensuring that whatever information he discovered perishes with him. The scene ends with the capsule containing Cory's warning message lying unnoticed beside his lifeless body.",
