The mood is somber and secretive: Cory reveals that their longtime comrade, Jeff Garvey, is dead and that a dark conspiracy is unfolding. He unfurls a document that grants him the authority to enlist any person\u2014military or civilian\u2014to confront the emerging menace. In a measured yet urgent tone, Cory reminds Lowery of an old legend: though the Daleks invaded Earth a thousand years ago, they have in recent centuries secretly gathered power by conquering innumerable distant planets. He explains that reports from a freighter navigator have described a Dalek spaceship and adds a chilling detail\u2014a Varga thorn, the poisonous seed of a plant that transforms its victim into a monstrous Varga, grows only on Skaro, the Daleks\u2019 home. Meanwhile, stage directions reveal that outside the ship, Garvey\u2019s twitching legs and creeping white spines foretell his horrifying metamorphosis into a Varga, underscoring the stakes of their mission. The scene is set entirely within the ship\u2019s interior, where every whispered word and exchanged look underscores the desperate need for answers about the Dalek threat.",

As Lowery recalls that Daleks once invaded Earth a thousand years ago, Cory outlines their surprising revival: despite a long period of inactivity within their own galaxy, in the past five hundred years the Daleks have conquered over seventy planets in one star system and forty in another. He further reveals that a recent report from a space freighter navigator described a spaceship matching the distinctive design of a Dalek vessel. Interwoven in his explanation is the ominous reference to a Varga thorn\u2014a poisonous, cactus-like appendage whose toxin incapacitates rational thought and gradually transforms its victim. Cory emphasizes that because such thorns, and therefore the Varga, grow naturally only on Skaro, their presence here implies that the Daleks have returned to this hostile region.",

Lowery is busy assembling a rescue beacon, a small metal framework with a capsule launcher that will record and transmit a distress message, while Cory makes rounds around the ship. Their brief, urgent dialogue reveals their concern about the possibility of an imminent Dalek attack even as they debate whether the Vargas \u2013 noted for their slow, rooted movement \u2013 are naturally occurring or synthetically developed in Dalek laboratories. The scene bristles with anxiety as they prepare their beacon for launch, knowing that the Daleks are expected to arrive soon.",

Their conversation is interspersed with grim humor as they bemoan the relentless threat posed by Vargas, hostile creatures edging ever closer to their ship. Their dialogue reveals both technical details about the beacon\u2019s operation and underlying anxiety about the Dalek menace that looms over the galaxy.

Their brief exchange is interrupted by the sudden appearance of Daleks. The Dalek attackers quickly inspect the ship, determine that the crew has abandoned it, and then ruthlessly order its destruction. As the Daleks fire, Lowery watches in horror as his ship is reduced to ruin while Cory urges him to move into the jungle. In the ensuing frantic escape, Lowery is painfully injured by a Varga thorn that embeds in his hand, forcing him into a panicked extraction of the thorn. Meanwhile, Daleks issue further orders to alert all patrols, setting the stage for the relentless hunt that now begins. This sequence vividly portrays the sudden and brutal transition from covert distress signalling to an overwhelming ambush by the Daleks, which shatters any hope of safe escape.",
