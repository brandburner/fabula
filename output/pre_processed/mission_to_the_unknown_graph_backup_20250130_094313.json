Daylight is filtering through the thick canopy, creating a muted, tense atmosphere. Marc Cory and Gordon Lowery are busy attempting to repair their rocket ship amidst the sounds of the jungle, including a loud screech that hints at lurking danger. As they work, Garvey, a hidden figure, is drawn closer by a primal urge to kill, driven by the effects of a Varga thorn. The confrontation escalates unexpectedly when Cory shoots Garvey, leading to an emotional outburst from Lowery, who grapples with feelings of betrayal and loss. In the aftermath, Cory examines the thorn embedded in Garvey's flesh, foreshadowing the dark transformation associated with the Varga species. The scene ends with Garvey lying motionless, but hints at his disturbing, gradual metamorphosis into a Varga plant.",

The atmosphere is tense, with the threat of the carnivorous Vargas lurking nearby. Lowery expresses a desire to shoot at the Vargas, but Cory warns him that it would be futile since they regenerate quickly. Lowery assures Cory that the beacon they are attempting to activate is standard safety equipment meant to transmit their distress signal to any listening outposts in the galaxy. As they discuss their plans, the tension escalates with the arrival of an unidentified massive craft overhead, heightening the sense of impending danger, especially with the possible involvement of the Daleks threatening their galaxy.",

The atmosphere is tense, filled with anticipation as the Dalek Supreme prepares to commence the assembly with its various emissaries present. Malpha, representing one of the outer galaxies, makes a dramatic entrance as the last delegate before the meeting can begin. He disrupts the proceedings by announcing the presence of a hostile influence among them, creating an air of unease. The Dalek Supreme, however, reassures the delegates that the intruders' spaceship has been destroyed and that the beings are being hunted down. Malpha\u2019s concern about the possibility of the beings sending a message through the universe is met with the Dalek Supreme's insistence that they will not have the time to do so, reiterating the Daleks\u2019 assurance of their extermination.",

Cory arrives, urgency in his voice as he reveals that a Dalek city lies ahead and they need to act quickly. A grim realization hits Cory as he understands the truth about the Varga infecting Lowery, who, in his madness, chants the word 'Kill' before turning his weapon on himself. Cory records a desperate warning about the impending invasion and destruction of their galaxy by the Daleks, just as the Daleks close in on him, marking a moment of tension as he struggles to send the message. Unfortunately, he is ultimately intercepted, leading to his death as the Daleks continue their plans for conquest, unaware of the warning left behind.",
