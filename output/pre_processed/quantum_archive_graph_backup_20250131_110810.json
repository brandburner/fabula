The Doctor arrives through the materialization of the TARDIS, commenting on the architecture and the catastrophic situation, raising questions about the motives behind the attack.",

It is a tense moment as K'nell's crystalline form strains under the pressure of purging protocols, while Dr. Chen monitors the situation with a quantum analyzer indicating critical pattern convergence. Director Malik announces a significant breach in the systems, but is interrupted by the emergence of a shimmering consciousness of chronometric energy, symbolizing the awakened power of time. The Doctor confronts the Entropy Syndicate operatives who find themselves frozen in temporal stasis, their actions caught in a loop, particularly highlighting Voss's futile attempt to escape. The Doctor asserts that time is sentient and now aware due to the Syndicate's meddling, emphasizing the dangers of treating time as merely a mathematical equation.",
