Following a crisis, K'nell's damaged crystal matrix is regenerating, and the Archive's temporal stability is returning to normal, although fundamental changes persist.  Compromised records are quantum-locked, inaccessible even to K'nell.  The Doctor reflects on the costs of unrestrained knowledge, while Dr. Chen observes that the Archive now displays signs of consciousness in its quantum matrices. The Doctor suggests that this newfound awareness may be beneficial. The scene concludes with the TARDIS dematerializing and the Archive implementing new security protocols, its crystals pulsing with a newfound sense of understanding.",
