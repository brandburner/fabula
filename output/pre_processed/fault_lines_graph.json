The corridors, still echoing from the footsteps of a strained Josh Lyman, lead us into a room bathed in the soft glow of dim lighting and illuminated by multiple LCD screens that broadcast satellite imagery of the troubled Kosovo-Serbia border region.

Amid murmurs of paramilitary claims and strategic assessments, the room\u2019s fragile calm shatters with the arrival of President Bartlet and his closest advisors. Every whispered dialogue and pained glance speaks to the weight of decisions yet to be made, as the administration grapples with the precarious balance between duty and moral reckoning.",
