It is filled with intricate temporal matrices and cascading data streams in ancient languages, creating a high-tech yet mystical atmosphere. Dr. Sarah Chen stands at a central control platform, troubled by the readings from her quantum-state analyzer, indicating that the temporal seals are degrading, threatening centuries of preserved data. The ancient Archivist Prime K'nell, a crystalline being that refracts temporal energies, expresses agitation over the attack from the Entropy Syndicate. They require help beyond their capacity, hinting at the need for someone with specialized knowledge. Meanwhile, junior archivists are seen working anxiously at consoles, as a holographic display illustrates the spreading temporal decay. The tension peaks as the TARDIS materializes, emitting familiar sounds, with The Doctor assessing the situation and questioning the motives behind the destruction of the archives.",

K'nell, in their crystalline form, experiences fractures while channeling purging protocols. Dr. Chen utilizes a quantum analyzer, revealing critical pattern convergence. Director Malik identifies a systems breach at 87% but is interrupted by the emergence of a shimmering consciousness formed from the Archive's temporal knowledge. The Doctor confronts Malik, implying that time itself has awakened and is now judgmental, as the Entropy Syndicate operatives are frozen in temporal stasis. Voss, in a futile attempt to escape, becomes entrapped in a causality loop. Malik's disbelief grows as he realizes the complexity of time cannot be reduced to mere calculations, while the Doctor emphasizes the sentience of time thanks to their actions.",
