The Doctor races against time at the central control nexus, while Dr. Sarah Chen and Archivist Prime K'nell coordinate emergency defense protocols. In a shocking turn, Coordinator Voss reveals their infiltration by attempting to disable the temporal containment fields. The Doctor urgently warns of the catastrophic consequences of their actions, stating that the Moment was not just a weapon but a sentient force with the capability to pass judgment.
