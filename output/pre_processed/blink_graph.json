							"description": "In the gloomy entrance hall of the Wester Drumlins house, Sally Sparrow is confronted with a shocking letter and old photographs from her friend Kathy Nightingale, revealing that Kathy named her youngest child after Sally and that their last interaction has spanned over sixty years. Disturbed by the uncanny implications, Sally throws down the photographs in frustration as she searches for Kathy, calling her name in growing panic. As she ascends the staircase, three Weeping Angel statues are revealed on the landing. One statue holds a Yale key, and as Sally inspects it, another statue discreetly reveals its eyes. After taking the key, Sally hears the front door close and hastily bolts downstairs, just narrowly avoiding the potentially deadly grasp of the statue. She collects the scattered photographs and letters and rushes outside, unaware of the statues observing her from the windows.",

Meanwhile, Larry reveals his fascination with the Doctor's appearances on DVD easter eggs, describing how he has mysteriously appeared on seventeen unrelated DVDs across the internet. The interaction between Sally and Larry unfolds with hints of humor, confusion, and urgency as they navigate time and messages. Amidst this, the Doctor, on screen, shares insights about time being non-linear while Sally experiences a strange sense of connection with the recorded image as it seems to hear her. Just as things heighten in tension, Larry steps away briefly, leading to more revelations when he returns with the list of DVDs, hinting at Sally's pivotal role in the unfolding narrative.",
