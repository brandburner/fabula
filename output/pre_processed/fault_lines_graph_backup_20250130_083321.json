Relief quickly spreads through the room, but Josh Lyman remains at the window, deeply contemplative, as he articulates his fears about the moral choices nations make in times of crisis. President Bartlet, observing the emotions of his staff, instructs Charlie Young to arrange calls with President Kovach and key party leaders, emphasizing the need to inform the American public about the near-disaster. The sense of relief is palpable, yet the scene underscores the precarious balance of power and justice the White House staff navigates.",
