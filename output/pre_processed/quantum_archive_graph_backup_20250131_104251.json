Director Malik alerts the team to a systems breach nearing critical levels, only to be interrupted as a shimmering consciousness made of chronometric energy manifests, representing the awakened essence of time itself. The Doctor confronts Malik, asserting that they will now face time's judgment, revealing the consequences of their actions as Entropy Syndicate operatives freeze in temporal stasis. Specific operatives, especially Voss, are caught in a causal loop, unable to escape from their temporal fate. Director Malik expresses disbelief about the situation, claiming calculations accounted for all variables.

It is marked by the chaos of entropic energy crackling as multiple spacetime fractures occur. Director Malik, determined to seize knowledge from the Archive, commands his operatives to secure the facility while asserting that the secrets of the Time War will be theirs. Meanwhile, The Doctor desperately attempts to stabilize the situation at the central control nexus, joined by Dr. Chen and K'nell, who are working to implement emergency protocols. In a shocking turn, Coordinator Voss reveals their allegiance by trying to disable the containment fields, adding tension to the already fraught atmosphere. The Doctor warns of the dangers posed by the Moment, emphasizing it as a conscious force judging time and space. Dr. Chen calculates that the virus is not merely searching but is assembling something significant across various timeline nodes, hinting at further complications ahead.",

The Doctor advises caution, suggesting some shadows are better left unexplored, reflecting on the reasons behind the Time War's conclusion. Dr. Chen observes that while the temporal scarring will heal, the Archive itself is now different, indicating signs of consciousness within the quantum matrices. The Doctor contemplates the newfound responsibility that comes with this knowledge, concluding that perhaps a conscious library is what is needed. As the TARDIS dematerializes, K'nell begins new security protocols, and the Archive's quantum crystals pulse with renewed purpose, hinting at not merely storage capabilities but a deeper understanding, ensuring that time's secrets are now safeguarded by an awareness of its own.",
