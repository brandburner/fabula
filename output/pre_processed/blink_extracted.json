She breaks in through a boarded up window and takes photographs of the plastic covered chandeliers resting on the floors, and other pieces of furniture. Then she notices the letter B peeking from underneath a piece of peeling wallpaper. She pulls at it to reveal the words Beware the weeping angel. Underneath that is Oh, and duck! Really, duck! Sally Sparrow duck, now. So she ducks just before the window behind her is broken by a thrown pot, which bounces off the wall and breaks on the floor. The light of her torch reveals a statue outside, a winged angel with its hands covering its face. She goes back to the wall and pulls off more paper to reveal - Love from the Doctor (1969"

She proceeds up the gravel driveway towards the old house, breaking in through a boarded-up window. Inside the dimly lit interior, with plastic-covered chandeliers scattered on the floor, she takes photographs and becomes captivated by the eerie atmosphere. Sally\u2019s attention is caught by a piece of peeling wallpaper, where she begins to reveal the message 'Beware the Weeping Angel'. She curiously continues to pull at the wallpaper, uncovering urgent instructions: 'Oh, and duck! Really, duck! Sally Sparrow duck, now.' Heeding the warning, she ducks just in time to avoid a pot thrown through the window behind her, shattering against the wall. A flash from her torch reveals the statue of a winged angel outside, its hands covering its face. Sally returns to the wall, pulls off more paper, and finds the message signed 'Love from the Doctor, 1969'.",

The scene takes place in the entrance hall of Wester Drumlins House, where old photographs reveal a connection between Sally's friend Kathy and Malcolm's grandmother. The old, dimly lit hall heightens the emotions and uncertainty present in the conversation. Sally, shocked yet curious, realizes the resemblance between the photograph and her friend Kathy, prompting her to inquire more about the familial link. Malcolm, taken aback, initially misunderstands Sally's excitement, leading to a moment of confusion as Sally makes the connection.",

The atmosphere is tense and eerie, filled with a sense of foreboding as Sally discovers that she has a namesake from the past. She reacts with disbelief, feeling sick at the implications of the letter. As she reads, she becomes frantic, calling out for Kathy. Upon reaching the landing, she encounters three Weeping Angels, each adopting different positions, hiding their eyes. One of the statues is clutching a Yale key. As Sally crouches to inspect it, another statue reveals its eyes behind her. In a panic, she grabs the key, turns, and dashes down the stairs just in time to avoid being touched by the statue, which has now resumed its frozen position. She quickly retrieves the photographs and letters from the banister rail and runs outside, oblivious to the watching statues in the windows.",

She hears the Doctor's voice on the screen as he calls out for Martha, while Larry enters the room, still processing the situation. Sally and Larry engage in a conversation about Kathy and the message she left for him. Tension builds as they discuss the mysterious Doctor who is hidden across various DVDs, and the nature of time travel. Larry reveals he has a list of the seventeen DVDs that hold the Doctor's Easter eggs, hinting at the deeper connections between them and how time works. The atmosphere is a mix of light-hearted banter and the underlying tension of their precarious situation.",

The DOCTOR greets him and informs him that it's 1969, suggesting that he has a bright future with the upcoming moon landing. MARTHA, standing by, adds that they have traveled to the moon multiple times before. The DOCTOR explains the bizarre circumstances of Billy's arrival, attributing it to the Weeping Angels, who can send people back in time while feeding off their potential energy. BILLY expresses his bewilderment, prompting MARTHA to suggest that he simply nod while the DOCTOR explains. The DOCTOR introduces his quirky timey-wimey detector, a device that highlights the absurdity of their situation. He then informs BILLY that he cannot offer a ride home due to his transportation being stolen and instead asks him to relay a message to Sally Sparrow. The scene is infused with a mix of humor and urgency as the characters grapple with the implications of time travel.",

SALLY approaches the bed, awakening BILLY, who softly recalls the moment they first met, reflecting on the rain that accompanied their encounter. Their conversation drifts into nostalgia as SALLY looks at a photograph, which prompts BILLY to reminisce about his late wife, also named Sally. BILLY reveals the reason for his visit, carrying a message from the Doctor, instructing SALLY to 'look at the list.' As they discuss the significance of a list of seventeen DVDs, SALLY grapples with the mystery of how the Doctor could know her belongings. BILLY, understanding the gravity of their meeting, shares that this is their last encounter before his passing, emphasizing the importance of their shared memories. The scene captures a poignant moment as SALLY vows to stay with BILLY until the end, only to later discover his bed empty after the rain stops, signifying his departure.",

As they watch, the Doctor speaks to them from the screen, seemingly responding to their questions. Sally becomes increasingly anxious as she realizes the Doctor can predict their words. The Doctor explains the nature of time, emphasizing its complexity and the danger posed by the Weeping Angels. Meanwhile, the tension builds as the Angels draw closer, threatening their safety. Larry holds a transcript of the Doctor's dialogue, detailing the unfolding situation while uncertainty looms in the air. The emotional tone is a mix of fear, urgency, and intrigue as the characters grapple with overwhelming knowledge and impending danger.",
