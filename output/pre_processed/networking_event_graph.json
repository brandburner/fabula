Jeremy Usbourne, with his usual mix of improvisation and misplaced confidence, sets up DJ equipment borrowed from Super Hans. This setup, a relic from a failed silent disco venture, is aimed at creating what Jeremy pitches as a 'scientifically-engineered productivity soundscape.' Alan Johnson, the potential merger partner and CEO of Johnson Dynamic Solutions, and Charlotte Walsh-Henderson, Mark\u2019s new boss, are present. As Jeremy launches into his chaotic blend of sounds, Johnson commends the disruptive and raw nature of the presentation, leading to Jeremy being signed up for a full rollout despite the unconventional nature of the pitch. Mark, observing this unfold, internally contemplates an escape from his current trajectory into a simpler life at Pret A Manger.",

The atmosphere is casual, with Mark quietly nursing a warm white wine while Jeremy energetically engages with Super Hans. In a celebratory mood, Jeremy dreams of global success with his new sonic optimization venture, comparing it to legal drugs for offices, while Super Hans boasts about his own tech venture aspirations. Meanwhile, Mark receives a notification that Steve from accounts has endorsed Jeremy on LinkedIn for 'Digital Transformation' and 'Change Management,' leading to his bemusements about Jeremy's rising corporate fortunes. The emotional tone is a mix of triumph for Jeremy and disillusionment for Mark, who contemplates the irony of Jeremy's misunderstood success.",
