He announces his plan to deliver a 'scientifically-engineered productivity soundscape' mixing electronic beats, office printer noises, and ambiguous sounds reminiscent of Buddhist chants or malfunctioning air conditioning. Alan Johnson, CEO of Johnson Dynamic Solutions and a potential merger partner for MetricShift, watches with keen interest and promptly instructs Charlotte to sign Jeremy up for a full rollout. In the background, Mark silently observes, his inner monologue filled with anxiety and resigned humor about his fading prospects in the corporate hierarchy.",
