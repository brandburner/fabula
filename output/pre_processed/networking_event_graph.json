Charlotte Walsh-Henderson, the Head of Digital Transformation, meticulously organizes kombucha stations, embodying a blend of corporate enthusiasm and past entrepreneurial failures. Mark stands nervously by the fruit-infused water station, adjusting his LinkedIn Premium name badge. Tension rises as Jeremy approaches Charlotte, prompting Mark's inner monologue filled with dread about Jeremy's potential success. Charlotte engages Jeremy in conversation about his aspirations in 'sonic optimization', to which Jeremy humorously blends concepts of mindfulness, blockchain, and casual drug references, marking a disconcerting but exciting moment for Mark as he realizes Jeremy is gaining serious recognition.",
