I played, as usual, into Messalina's hands. She had fallen manically in love with Gaius Silius, the Consul-Elect and the handsomest man in Rome. Knowing Mnester to be on close terms with the family, she had asked him to bring Silius to see her. And Mnester had refused out of respect for Silius' wife. Hence Messalina's complaints to me. Like a fool, I secured for her what she most wanted. He was not an easy victim of her passion, but she was clever.. She did not talk at first of love, but of politics. Tiberius had executed his father and she played, on that, telling him I was more corrupt even than Tiberius Before he realized it, he was comforting her. Before he realized it, he was making love to her. He was as much her abject slave as I was. Claudius, Claudius, you go too fast. Too fast."
