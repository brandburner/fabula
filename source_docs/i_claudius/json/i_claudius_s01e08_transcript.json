The room feels oppressive, mirroring the fear that has gripped Rome in the wake of Livia's death and Tiberius's retreat to Capri. ANTONIA, a woman of strong character etched with worry, sits rigidly in a high-backed chair. APICATA, distraught and desperate, stands before her."

No one was safe... Sejanus arrested Agrippina, her eldest son Nero, and countless others besides. His ambition was limitless. He had divorced his wife... Apicata... and become my sister's.. Livilla's. ..lover - hoping to marry her. My mother remained curiously innocent of much that was going on, until one day, Apicata came to visit her. Sejanus had taken their children with him and Apicata wanted them back. She feared my sister would harm them once married to Sejanus. Now she demanded that my mother speak to my sister and enlist her help."

And now you complain because he treats you as were once content to see him treat others! You disgust me, all of you! You and people like you have made a sewer of Rome, fit only for rats to live in! Honor, service, duty mean nothing any more. Well, your children are everything to you? And what of Rome? All you are, you owe to Rome.

Your daughter's husband died no natural death. Castor was murdered by your daughter. Sejanus supplied the poison but she fed it to him. Believe me, that guilty pair are set upon a course that would lead them to a kingly crown - they'll settle for nothing less.
