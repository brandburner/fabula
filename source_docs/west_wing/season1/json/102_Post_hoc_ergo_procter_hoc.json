As she stops for the red light, she sees three people across the street near the Capitol Building. She honks the car's horn several times. Senator LLOYD RUSSELL is one of the three men. He looks at the car and shakes his head. As the traffic light turns green, Mandy drives fast across the street, through and against the curb, and leaves her car there.",

What was first thought to be a mechanical failure was then claimed by a fundamentalist group after a keyhole satellite sent back a record of a heat stream coming from what's called an F.I.M. 92, which is a shoulder-mounted surface-to-air missile launcher. In the last 90 minutes or so that's been debunked as well. Hard intelligence is telling us the order came from the Syrian defense ministry. Baker and Lennox are on their way from the Pentagon, and Brodie's in the Situation Room preparing for your briefing. Bartlet takes a moment before he speaks.",
