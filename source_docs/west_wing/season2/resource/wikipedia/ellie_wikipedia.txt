Deborah "Debbie" Fiderer (Lily Tomlin): The President's executive secretary, hired after the death of the previous secretary, Mrs Landingham (Seasons 4–7). Charlie arranges her first interview with the President against her own wishes, in which she is groggy from prescription medication and performs badly by confessing to being both a professional gambler and then an alpaca farmer. Charlie later successfully pushes for her to be re-considered. When President Bartlet learns the reason she lost her previous White House personnel job — she had defied the Director of Personnel by hiring Charlie rather than a wealthy Bartlet supporter's unqualified son — and, though appearing very quirky, he sees she is actually very smart and capable, he hires her on the spot.
Margaret Hooper (NiCole Robinson): Assistant to chiefs of staff Leo McGarry (Seasons 1–6) and C. J. Cregg (Seasons 6–7). She is often focused on the minutiae of life. Particular devoted to and protective of Leo — frequently found snooping in on his private meetings — but she has a rebellious streak, so they are often at odds with their working styles. She is visibly pregnant in season 6, with no clear information about the father, and her baby is never seen on the show.

=== Office of the White House Counsel ===

Lionel Tribbey (John Larroquette): The fourth White House Counsel of the Bartlet administration and the first to appear in the series. He has very liberal views and is animated and theatrical.
Oliver Babish (Oliver Platt): The fifth and final White House Counsel of the Bartlet administration and the second of the two characters to be shown in that position during the series. Diligent and zealous, he first appears advising President Bartlet when the President is considering revealing his diagnosis of multiple sclerosis to the public. He appears connected to this plot-line into season three, then returns to the series in season seven to participate in the White House's internal investigation into the military shuttle leak. He later decamps to a law firm in the wake of the outgoing Bartlet Administration and is later mentioned by Santos as a potential choice for Attorney General. He is described by Josh Lyman as "smart and tough".
Ainsley Hayes (Emily Procter): Associate (and proposed Deputy) White House Counsel (Seasons 2–3). Conservative Republican from North Carolina. Graduate of Harvard Law School. After she soundly defeats and embarrasses Sam during a debate on the political talk show Capital Beat, President Bartlet tells Leo McGarry to offer her a job, which after initially believing she is being rebuked, she thinks is either a joke or a terrible idea, but when seeing the White House staff in action in a crisis, leads her to accept the Associate White House Counsel's post. Primarily, she appears as a foil to Sam Seaborn, making him reconsider his position on policies. She briefly reappears in season 7, wanting to become White House Counsel for the Santos Administration with Josh planning on getting her a meeting with Santos.
Joe Quincy (Matthew Perry): Associate White House Counsel (Seasons 4–5). Republican. He uncovers Vice President Hoynes's leaking of information during an affair with local socialite Helen Baldwin, ultimately leading to Hoynes's resignation.

General Nicholas Alexander (Terry O'Quinn): an ex-Green Beret. He succeeds Admiral Fitzwallace as a much more hawkish Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Seasons 5–6).
Dr. Nancy McNally (Anna Deavere Smith): National Security Advisor. She can appear to be either a 'war dove' or 'war hawk' depending upon the situation, but is always fair and usually right on the money with a situation.

Lieutenant Commander Jack Reese (Christian Slater): Aide to National Security Advisor Nancy McNally (season 4) and briefly dates Donna.

He appears in episode 2.05 berating C.J. for reprimanding his intentions to condemn on TV the President's failure to ensure military preparedness before his retirement, but is left silent when C.J. tells him he is wearing a Distinguished Combat Service Medal he had not earned; later however, Bartlet says the General served his country bravely and would face no White House censorship of any of his views. Despite being identified as Army Chief of Staff, he is portrayed as a three-star lieutenant general.
General Mitch Jensen (Christopher Kriesa): A three-star Army general. Present in the Situation Room during discussions of retaliatory options to Morris Tolliver's USAF medical transport being shot down in episode 1.03.

CIA Director George Rollie (Ryan Cutrona): President Bartlet does not trust or like him, but as C.J. and Toby note in "365 Days", his pariah status is useful because it prevents the President from tearing down anyone else during tense situations.
Mr Cashman: (unseen character) Often mentioned alongside Secretaries Hutchinson and Berryhill, implied to be a senior official at one of the Executive Branch departments, the department of either State or Defense (Seasons 1–2).
Bobby Dunn (Gary Cervantes): Appears in episodes (1.11), (1.22), (2.01), (2.10), and (2.21); apparently a State Department official.

Ted Barrow (Ron Canada): Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. Appears in Seasons 5–7. In season 5, tends to be harsh with the senior staffers and notably sympathetic to the views of North Korea; in later appearances, he is more measured and diplomatic.

Miguel "Mickey" Troop (Tony Plana): Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs.

=== Federal legislative branch ===
Senator Seth Gillette (Ed Begley, Jr.): Democrat from North Dakota. He threatened to run against President Bartlet as a third-party candidate on a more left-wing platform in the 2002 election (Ep 2.14).
Rep. Jeff Haffley (Steven Culp): Republican from Washington; House Majority Whip, 1997–2003, Speaker of the House, 2003–2007

Later a contender for the Republican presidential nomination in the 2006 election, though he never appeared on screen in that capacity.


=== State governors ===
Eric Baker (Ed O'Neill): Governor of Pennsylvania. He is widely tipped as a front runner for the Democratic nomination for president in 2006, but Baker's surprise decision not to run at the outset leaves the race wide open. When the convention is deadlocked, Baker enters the race from the floor as a draft candidate, but withdraws over fallout due to the discovery of his non-disclosure of his wife's depression.

== Campaign staff ==
Bruno Gianelli (Ron Silver): A sharp political operative and consultant introduced in the third season as the campaign manager of Bartlet's 2002 bid for reelection, his unmatched track record of victories includes a House district that no Democrat has won for decades, several different U.S. senators and state governors, and a win for an unspecified Israeli prime minister. The character reappears as Eric Baker's campaign manager for the 2006 Democratic primary, only to become an independent consultant to Republican nominee Arnold Vinick after Baker withdraws from the race. The change of political affiliations mirrored Ron Silver's real-world change of party affiliation, as the noted liberal actor campaigned for President George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election.
Josephine "Joey" Lucas (Marlee Matlin): A political consultant and pollster who is often hired by the White House and Democratic campaigns. Usually, her interactions with Bartlet or Matt Santos are arranged by Josh Lyman, who has a crush on her early on. However, their relationship remains platonic and professional. Lucas first appears in the first season as the hard-hitting, sarcastic campaign manager for a Democratic House candidate whom the White House does not take seriously. She is then contracted to conduct a secret poll to determine whether the American public would accept the president's MS. Like Matlin, Lucas is deaf.
Kenny Thurman (Bill O'Brien): Joey Lucas's sign language interpreter (Seasons 1–7).
Connie Tate (Connie Britton): A Bartlet-Hoynes reelection campaign staffer (season 3), she is a likable woman who quickly befriends Sam Seaborn. Often wins points by smoothing feathers ruffled by her acerbic co-worker Doug Wegland.
Doug Wegland (Evan Handler): A Bartlet–Hoynes reelection campaign staffer and speechwriter (season 3), he is acerbic and finds himself offside with Toby Ziegler but ends up winning the staffers' respect with his good ideas and staunch belief in them (particularly his push for a presidential veto on the "death tax" that leads to a major political victory for the administration).
Kevin Kahn (Patrick Breen): Former friend of Sam Seaborn. He is a staffer on Ritchie's 2002 presidential campaign (season 3) who ends up humiliating Sam by leaking an attack ad that makes the Bartlet campaign look vindictive and stupid.
Dylan Clark (Tim Kelleher): Hoynes' campaign manager (season 6).


=== Santos campaign ===
Louise "Lou" Thornton (Janeane Garofalo): an intelligent lobbyist described by Santos as having a "completely different take on the campaign" and by Josh as knowing "image stuff backwards and sideways", she only reluctantly agrees to Josh's request to join the Santos—–McGarry campaign as Director of Communications, when Santos agrees she can report to him directly. She acts as Josh's de facto deputy throughout the campaign, and at Josh's persuasion, accepts her appointment as Santos's Director of Communications (season 7).
Ronna Beckman (Karis Campbell): Santos's personal assistant. She is present from the very beginning of Matt Santos's campaign for the presidency in season 6 (appearing as part of his Congressional staff). In her final appearance, Deborah Fiderer trains her as Santos's executive secretary, warning her never to revoke the First Lady's walk-in privileges, even as the President is certain to request it. She has a relationship with another female staffer (Cindy) on the Santos campaign.
Edie Ortega (Diana-Maria Riva): Santos—–McGarry Deputy Campaign Manager for Strategic Planning (season 7).
Lester (Cress Williams): Santos—–McGarry Campaign Consultant (season 7).

Ned Carlson (Evan Arnold): A day-one aide to Congressman Santos (season 6); Staffer, Santos—–McGarry Campaign (seasons 6–7). He is removed from the campaign and reassigned to Santos's Congressional office early in season 7 after Lou considers that he is out of his depth.
Otto (Ramon De Ocampo): Speechwriter, Santos—–McGarry Campaign (season 7); Staffer in the Santos Administration (season 7). Very young but capable man who has a campaign fling with Lou Thornton.  It is implied he will have a speechwriting role in the Santos Administration.


=== Vinick campaign ===
Sheila Brooks (Patricia Richardson): Senator Vinick's chief of staff and Vinick–Sullivan campaign manager; She, like Vinick, is portrayed as level-headed and not overtly partisan. Often at odds with the more conservative voices in the party, she leaves the campaign weeks before election day to placate the Republican base (season 6–7). In her final appearance, Brooks is mentioned as possibly being hired as Chief of Staff to the Republican Senate Majority Leader. Having renewed her friendship with Vinick, she makes an argument that convinces the Senator that he should not run for president again—and that he should accept President-elect Santos' offer to become the next Secretary of State.
Jane Braun (Melinda McGraw): Vinick–Sullivan campaign manager after Brooks' resignation (season 7); A far-to-the-right conservative activist who replaces Sheila to energize hard-core GOP voters. However, she disgusts the rest of the campaign leadership by attempting to make an election night issue of Leo McGarry's death. Her outspoken partisanship puts her at odds with Vinick, Sheila, and Bruno Gianelli.
Bruno Gianelli (Ron Silver): (See above).
Bob Mayer (Stephen Root): Vinick–Sullivan speechwriter (season 6–7). Frequently mocked for his messy eating habits but extremely smart and effective (and, like Vinick and Sheila Brooks, level-headed in his conservatism), Mayer becomes fast friends with Gianelli. On election night, the two briefly discuss forming a consulting firm when Mayer firmly declares he is never going to become involved in daily governance, but Gianelli politely declines because the campaign life has worn him down and he plans to retire to his home in upstate New York. Along with Sheila, Bob advises Vinick to accept Santos' offer as the next Secretary of State.

He writes a story that reveals the classified information that a military space shuttle exists that could be used to rescue three astronauts on the International Space Station who are running out of oxygen. Brock’s source is initially suspected to be C. J. Cregg, whose phone records show a large number of calls to him. He refuses to reveal his source, is accordingly held in contempt of court, and goes to jail. He is presumably released after White House Communications Director Toby Ziegler confesses to the leak, saying thatBrock was the only reporter to whom he leaked the information.
