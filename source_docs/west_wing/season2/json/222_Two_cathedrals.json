As the motorcade pulls up in front of the church, with sirens still blaring, the sound of an organ playing a processional fills the air. The Presidential limousine stops in front of the steps leading to the main entrance. Secret Service agents open the limousine doors for Bartlet and Abbey, who get out on opposite sides of the vehicle. Bartlet walks around the back of the limousine and looks up at the huge building with a mixture of weariness and sadness. Abbey walks up the steps by his side and gently takes his hand. He lets her take it but doesn't react. They walk inside.",

Almost all of the attendees are seated as several Secret Service agents and ushers guide Abbey and Bartlet to a pew in the front. Abbey sits down and Bartlet sits down beside her, exhaling as he sits, as if it takes considerable effort for him to do so. REVEREND MONOHAN is seated at the front of the cathedral, facing the congregants. Once Bartlet and Abbey are seated, Monohan stands up. He is accompanied to the pulpit by a layperson. Toby, C.J., and Charlie look on from their seats.",
