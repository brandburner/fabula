Pools of light illuminate the darkness as Leo slowly and reluctantly makes his way toward THE OVAL OFFICE. He appears dazed and he moves with the stiffness of a much older man. His clothes seem to hang on him. As he reaches the French doors, the light from the office reveals the apprehension and dread on his face. Bartlet is standing, with his back turned, reading a document and talking on the phone. Leo does not move for a several seconds; he appears even older and more frail through the wavy glass in the French doors. When he finally reaches for the door knob, Bartlet notices him and gestures for him to come in, which he does. Leo closes the door. Bartlet hangs up the phone, removes his glasses, and turns toward Leo. Through the wavy glass, Bartlet's features are distorted somewhat as he listens to Leo speak. Bartlet cocks his head slightly to one side as Leo breaks the sad news.",
