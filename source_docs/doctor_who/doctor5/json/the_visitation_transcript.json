The android enters as everything starts to shake. It tries firing at the disrupter, but has no effect. The vibrations increase and little trinket boxes bounce off the dressing table. The android turns its fire on the power cable, but smoke is beginning to come out of its joints. Finally the mechanical man explodes. Nyssa comes out of hiding and turns off the disrupter, then gets a small fire extinguisher to put out the fires in power cable and the android's remains.
