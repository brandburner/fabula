He goes over and turns down the audio of the birdcall in the jungle and moves a piece of equipment to another desk. The chairs have peoples names printed on them, like director's chairs. Then he picks up a tribal mask with a fringe of coloured wool, puts it in front of his face and spins the young man's chair round to wake him."
