        "This story had the working title Sentinel.",
        "Killing off Adric makes some sense story-wise. The Doctor would never purposely return to E-Space, so that would leave Adric indefinitely stuck on the TARDIS; given Adric doesn't have a place in N-Space to call home, like the rest of the companions.",
        "Producer John Nathan-Turner was keen to keep the return of the Cybermen a surprise, and therefore ensured that this aspect was given no advance publicity \u2014 even going so far as to arrange for the studio observation galleries to be closed for the duration of recording and turning down Radio Times when they offered to feature the Cybermen in a cover photograph and article to mark the start of the story, much to Sarah Sutton's disappointment.",
        "The Cyber-Leader and Cyber-Lieutenant were also referred to as simply \"Leader\" and \"Lieutenant\" in the combined Radio Times cast for parts one/two.",
        "This is the first Cybermen story which neither of their creators, Kit Pedler and Gerry Davis, had involvement with.",
        "Adric's appearance in part two of Time-Flight is solely so he would be credited in the following week's issue of Radio Times, which would be published on the day Earthshock part four aired \u2014 therefore hiding his death here.",
        "This is one of the few serials in which the ending credits have been changed from the regular credits. Adric's star-shaped badge for mathematical excellence is shown broken in pieces while the credits roll in silence.",
        "It's also the first time a serial has used scrolling credits since TV: The War Games and the only story in the JN-T era to do so.",
        "This story features a very rare occasion where the Doctor not only uses a weapon, but also kills with it.",
        "The multiple rows of marching Cybermen in part four was actually a single row duplicated and placed side by side using photographic editing.",
        "One of the android costumes would later be repainted silver and used as the costume for the Raston Warrior Robot in The Five Doctors."
