Meanwhile, across time and space, the First, Second, Third and Fourth Doctors are kidnapped by a mysterious figure using a forbidden Time Scoop device. \n\nThe Fifth Doctor travels to Gallifrey and discovers that the Time Lords' leader, Borusa, has been using the Time Scoop to bring the Doctors and their companions to the Death Zone on Gallifrey, where they must navigate dangerous obstacles to reach the Dark Tower and the tomb of Rassilon, who discovered the secret of immortality. \n\nThe Doctors and their companions face threats from the Daleks, Cybermen, Yeti and other adversaries as they make their way towards the Tower. Borusa, revealed to be the one controlling the Time Scoop, seeks to claim Rassilon's secret of immortality for himself. The Doctors combine their wills to free the Fifth Doctor from Borusa's control, and Borusa is transformed into a stone face, trapped with others who sought immortality. \n\nRassilon then appears and offers the Doctors immortality, but they all refuse. Rassilon sends the Doctors and their companions back to their proper places in time, with the Fifth Doctor becoming the new President of Gallifrey, much to his reluctance."
