    "additional_notes": "The Doctor's hair is as long as it gets, positively flowing. Tegan's hair might be a wig. Mark Strickson (Turlough) starts the story at intensity 10 and works his way up to at least 15, with 'I'm not a spyyyyy!' being his most wonderfully over-the-top line.",
    "bottom_line": "A lyrical fantasy, with some original directorial approaches to space scenes, and a snappy, hugely-entertaining writing style. Janet Fielding is rather muted, but Mark Strickson delivers an intense performance. The overall impression is a lot of panting people, tearing up and down in a most entertaining way. Great music, too. All in all a glittering jewel, rather neglected."
