## Plot Summary
"Snakedance" is set on the planet Manussa, 500 years after the events of the previous serial "Kinda." The story begins with the TARDIS arriving on Manussa, which is celebrating the anniversary of the Mara's banishment. Tegan, one of the Doctor's companions, begins experiencing nightmares involving a snake-shaped cave mouth.

When Tegan and the Doctor discover the cave from her dreams, Tegan is overtaken by the Mara once again, leading to a series of events where the Mara seeks to manifest itself physically using a crystal. Throughout the story, Tegan and Lon, the indolent son of the ruler of Manussa, both fall under the control of the Mara.

The narrative explores themes of possession, identity, and the struggle against one's inner demons, culminating in a confrontation with the Mara's influence.
