## Plot Summary
"The Caves of Androzani" is a gripping four-part story that follows the Fifth Doctor and his companion, Peri Brown, as they arrive on the desolate planet Androzani Minor. The Doctor and Peri quickly become embroiled in a conflict over a rare substance known as "spectrox," which is coveted for its potent life-prolonging properties. They are mistakenly identified as gunrunners and captured by the ruthless General Chellak, who is in league with a powerful businessman named Morgus.

As the story unfolds, the Doctor learns about the power struggles between Morgus and Sharaz Jek, an android maker who is obsessed with his own creations and has a personal vendetta against Morgus. The conflict over spectrox leads to betrayal, death, and a series of treacherous encounters in the caves of Androzani, which are filled with deadly creatures and toxic conditions.

The Doctor and Peri face imminent execution and must navigate a landscape of deceit and danger to survive. The narrative reaches a climax as the Doctor is poisoned by spectrox and must regenerate to save himself and Peri. The regeneration leads to the introduction of the Sixth Doctor, marking a significant transition in the series.
