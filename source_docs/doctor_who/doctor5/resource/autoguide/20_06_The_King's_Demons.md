## Plot Summary:
Set in 1215, the Court of King John of England convenes at the castle of Sir Ranulf Fitzwilliam, where tensions escalate as the King demands increased taxes. When Sir Ranulf refuses, his son Hugh challenges the King's champion, Sir Gilles Estram, to a joust. The joust is abruptly interrupted by the arrival of the TARDIS, with the Fifth Doctor, Tegan, and Turlough stepping into the medieval conflict. Mysteriously welcomed as demons by the King, the Doctor quickly suspects that this monarch is not who he claims to be.

The true identity of King John is unveiled as the Master, who has cunningly usurped the throne with the assistance of Kamelion, a shape-shifting robot. The Master's goal is to manipulate events to prevent the signing of the Magna Carta, a crucial document that would alter the course of history. As the Doctor confronts the Master, he races against time to uncover the truth and thwart the Master's nefarious plans.

Ultimately, the Doctor restores order, ensuring the signing of the Magna Carta, and solidifying one of the most significant moments in the history of democracy.
