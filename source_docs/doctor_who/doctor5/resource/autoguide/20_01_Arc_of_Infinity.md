## Plot Summary
On Gallifrey, the Fifth Doctorâ€™s home planet, a Time Lord traitor steals the bio-data code of another Time Lord and provides it to the Renegade, a creature composed of antimatter. The High Council issues a Warrant of Termination on the Doctor to ensure the Renegade can no longer bond with him. Despite Nyssa's attempts to save him, the Doctor is taken for execution and placed in a dispersal chamber. However, the Renegade targets the Doctor's mind, plotting to cross into this dimension through him. 

Nyssa and Tegan work to uncover the truth and save the Doctor, leading to a confrontation with Omega, the powerful founder of the Time Lords, who has his own agenda to reclaim his place in the universe. The serial interweaves themes of betrayal, the nature of power, and the struggle between matter and antimatter, culminating in high-stakes drama on both Gallifrey and in the antimatter universe.
