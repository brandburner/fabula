## Plot Summary
"Planet of Fire" begins with the Fifth Doctor and his companion Turlough arriving on the volcanic planet Lanzarote. Here, they encounter Peri Brown, whom Turlough heroically saves from drowning. As the trio navigates the planet, they discover the worship of a volcano by the local inhabitants. The Master, a recurring nemesis of the Doctor, plots to manipulate the volcanic gases to restore himself, using the local culture's reverence for the volcano to his advantage.

Turlough faces his own past during their adventure, grappling with his former allegiances while Peri is caught between her survival instincts and the dynamics of her new companions. The tension escalates as the Doctor and his friends confront the Master's nefarious plans, culminating in a critical moment that shapes the futures of both Turlough and Peri.
