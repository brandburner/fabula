## Plot Summary
"The Awakening" is set in the fictional English village of Little Hodcombe in 1984, where the Fifth Doctor and his companions, Tegan Jovanka and Vislor Turlough, arrive for a visit to Tegan’s grandfather, Andrew Verney. Upon their arrival, they stumble upon a reenactment of the English Civil War, orchestrated by the local aristocrat Sir George Hutchinson.

As the Doctor investigates, he discovers that these war games are under the control of a psychic alien entity known as the Malus. The Malus feeds on the violent psychic energy generated by the conflicts and aims to awaken itself by intensifying the battles. The Doctor must intervene to prevent real violence from erupting in the village, as the Malus's influence grows stronger.

The story combines elements of historical drama and science fiction, addressing themes of memory, history, and the consequences of violence on society. "The Awakening" is significant as it showcases the transition in the Doctor Who format, being one of the last two-part episodes produced in the traditional 25-minute format before the show shifted to longer episodes.
