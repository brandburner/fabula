## Plot Summary
"Enlightenment" is the fifth serial of the 20th season of *Doctor Who*, featuring the Fifth Doctor and his companions Tegan and Turlough. The story begins with the Doctor materializing on a mysterious Edwardian sailing yacht in space. The crew of the yacht, alongside others, participates in a deadly cosmic race, with the ultimate prize being "Enlightenment" — the wisdom to achieve one's heart's desire.

The characters soon realize they are not merely racing for victory; they are entangled in a contest orchestrated by god-like immortals known as the Eternals. Each ship in the race is crewed by humans abducted from various points in time, who lack any recollection of how they arrived there.

As the race progresses, the Black Guardian attempts to manipulate Turlough, who is under his influence, to kill the Doctor. However, Turlough wrestles with his conscience, caught between the conflicting orders from the Black Guardian. The tension escalates as the stakes of the race intensify and the Eternals' true motives are revealed.

With stunning model shots and a gripping narrative, "Enlightenment" delves into themes of power, morality, and the quest for knowledge, culminating in a thrilling resolution where Turlough redeems himself, restoring the balance of power between the Guardians.

This serial is significant as it marks the first *Doctor Who* serial to be both written and directed by women, showcasing the innovative storytelling that characterized the series during its classic run.
