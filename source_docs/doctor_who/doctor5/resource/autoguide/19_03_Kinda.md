## Plot Summary
"Kinda" is the third serial of the 19th season of Doctor Who, exploring the dynamics of an Earth colonization survey expedition on the lush jungle planet Deva Loka. As the team members begin to mysteriously disappear, the Doctor and his companion Adric are drawn into a conflict involving the native Kinda tribe and a malevolent alien entity known as the Mara.

The story opens with the expedition's leader, Sanders, leaving his deputy Hindle in charge. Hindle's authority is supported by two captured members of the Kinda tribe, who have formed a telepathic connection with him. As Hindle's stability deteriorates, he grows increasingly paranoid, believing that the jungle is the source of their misfortunes and planning its destruction.

Central to the plot is the Mara, which utilizes Tegan's fears to manipulate her and ultimately seeks to take over the body of Kinda Aris. The Doctor must navigate the complexities of Kinda culture while grappling with Hindle's psychological instability to save Tegan and restore harmony to Deva Loka.

Themes of reality versus illusion, power struggles, and colonialism permeate the serial, culminating in a confrontation between the Doctor and the Mara that resolves the crisis on the planet.
