## Plot Summary
Set in an English estate in 1925, "Black Orchid" unfolds as the TARDIS crew arrives and encounters Lord Cranleigh's chauffeur, who has been anticipating "the Doctor." Lord Cranleigh invites the crew to stay for the annual ball, offering them costumes for the event. They meet Ann Talbot, Cranleigh's fiancée, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Nyssa. 

During a conversation, Lady Cranleigh reveals the significance of a black flower, the black orchid, discovered by her son George, a famed botanist. The Doctor, choosing a Harlequin costume, finds himself embroiled in a murder investigation when two servants are found dead amidst a case of mistaken identity.
