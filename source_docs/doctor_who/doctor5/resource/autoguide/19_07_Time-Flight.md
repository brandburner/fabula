"Time-Flight" is the seventh and final serial of Doctor Who's 19th season, consisting of four episodes.

The Fifth Doctor, accompanied by his companions Nyssa, Tegan, and Adric, investigates the Concorde's disappearance. Their inquiry leads them to confront the Master, who has assumed the guise of the sorcerer Kalid. The Master seeks to manipulate time and capture the Doctor, presenting a formidable challenge as the Doctor attempts to save the passengers and crew of the Concorde.

Throughout the adventure, the Doctor and his companions navigate treacherous jungle environments and confront Kalid's minions. The story culminates in a climactic showdown between the Doctor and the Master, where the Doctor must outwit his adversary to restore order and ensure the Concorde and its passengers return safely to their rightful timeline.
