The TARDIS materializes aboard a vast and advanced spacecraft, under the watchful eye of a hovering surveillance device. The Doctor and his companions, Tegan, Nyssa, and Adric, quickly find themselves separated. The Fifth Doctor and Tegan make their way to the bridge, where they encounter Monarch, the green-skinned commander of Urbanka, along with his Ministers of Enlightenment and Persuasion.

Monarch reveals his sinister plan to invade Earth for its mineral resources, intending to use a deadly toxin to exterminate humanity. The Doctor, along with Nyssa, Tegan, and Adric, must navigate this perilous situation, encountering Earthlings from various eras held captive aboard the spacecraft.

As they strategize to thwart Monarch's invasion, the group faces numerous challenges, including Adric’s initial betrayal when he inadvertently provides Monarch with critical information about the Doctor and the TARDIS. Realizing the gravity of his mistake, Adric must confront his conflicted loyalties, leading to a climactic confrontation that holds the fate of Earth in the balance.
