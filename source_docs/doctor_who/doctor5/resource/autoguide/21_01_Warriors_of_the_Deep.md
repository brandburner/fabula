## Plot Summary
Set in the year 2084, Earth is embroiled in a Cold War between two opposing superpowers. The Fifth Doctor, accompanied by his companions Tegan Jovanka and Vislor Turlough, arrives at Sea Base 4, an underwater military outpost under the command of Commander Vorshak. The base is currently overseeing missile launch tests in preparation for potential conflict.

The situation escalates dramatically when three Silurians, led by Icthar, revive the Sea Devils to assist in their plan to seize control of the base. Their ultimate objective is to utilize the base's nuclear arsenal to instigate a global war between the two superpowers, thereby allowing the Silurians and Sea Devils to reclaim the Earth.

As chaos ensues and the Sea Devils launch their attack, the Doctor must rely on his resourcefulness to thwart their plans. He ingeniously employs ultraviolet light to destroy the Myrka, a giant sea creature unleashed by the Silurians. Ultimately, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance, the Doctor connects his mind to the base's computer system to prevent the launch of nuclear missiles. Reluctantly, he also suggests using hexachromite gas to eliminate the remaining invaders.

The serial combines themes of political intrigue, ecological issues, and the dire consequences of warfare, while also marking the return of the Silurians and Sea Devils to the series. It is noted for its production challenges and critical reception, often cited as an example of a poorly executed Doctor Who story.
