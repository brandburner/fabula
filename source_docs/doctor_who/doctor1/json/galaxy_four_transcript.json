Gingerly he lowers his feet to the floor, freezing as the material beneath him creaks alarmingly. The Drahvin jerks and mumbles, but does not wake up. Only once he's sure that the guard is still asleep does Steven dare to move again. At last he's sitting directly in front of the Drahvin. He raises his hands, one aimed at her gun, the other at her mouth. Lunging forward, Steven quietly knocks the chair backwards and snatches for the gun. He turns it on the Drahvin, but there's no need. Examining her, he discovers she was knocked unconscious as she fell. All is quiet. Steven straightens and moves quickly to the door controls.
