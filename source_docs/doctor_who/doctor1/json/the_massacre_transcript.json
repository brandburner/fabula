Despite this, Steven know that it is vital he tells the Huguenots what he's learnt about the plot to murder the Sea Beggar.

He must hope that Nicholas will be prepared to listen to him. Steven is retracing his route back to the house when he senses that he's being followed.

He opens a case and takes from it an arquebus, a hand-held rifle of the latest design. Setting the arquebus on the tripod-like stand, Bondeaux trains the weapon on the street, and smiles. From his vantage point here he cannot fail to hit his target. At the end of the street, the Admiral de Coligny appears, returning home after the council meeting at the Louvre. He walks slowly, engrossed in a report he's reading. A group of courtiers follow him at a distance, talking quietly amongst themselves so as not to disturb him. Toligny is amongst them. Bondeaux fixes his sights on de Coligny and slowly squeezes the trigger. But a gust of wind snatches a page of the report from the Admiral's hand and he instinctively stoops to retrieve it just as Bondeaux fires the arquebus. de Coligny falls to the ground."
