No host of arms, no vast array of banners served this wicked lord. They were but few, ruthless, reckless men who obeyed his cruel commands. Thus did he persuade them. Promising paradise, he gave his followers a potent draught and whilst they slept transported them to a vale where streams of milk and honey, wine and water, flowed. Here were gardens and flowers of every hue and essence. Here, too Golden pavilions outshone the sun and even the stars of heaven envied the bejewelled interiors strewn with incomparable silks, tapestries, and treasures. Hand-maidens, dulcet-voiced, soft of face, attended them, and thus bemused did they dwell in this man-made paradise until Ala-eddin intent upon some evil deed, proffered again the hashish draught and brought them sleeping to his castle. What lord, are we cast out of paradise? Awakening, they cried. Not so. Go abroad, seek out my enemies and strike them down. But care not for your lives. Paradise is eternal. So terror stalked the land for many years. Then one day, came mighty Hulagu to stand before Ala-eddin's lair for three long years in siege. Thus fell Ala- eddin and his men. Now honest hands reap harvests of life From the soil where death and evil reigned. And those who journey through the vale are heard to say 'tis truly paradise today."
