        "The specific design of the Cybermen featured in this story would be seen in many adventures.",

        "The Eighth Doctor later encountered these rudimentary Cyberman variants in Vienna on 11 September 1873.",
        "The Twelfth Doctor and his companions later witnessed the inception of a version of these prototypical Cybermen, which he recognises on sight as a \"Mondasian Cyberman\", on a Mondasian colony ship that had been trapped in the grasp of a black hole.",
        "The Doctor claims his body is \"wearing a bit thin\". This phrase is echoed by his war incarnation before he regenerates.",
        "The Cybermen would later attempt to gain access to time travel, hoping to destroy Earth in 1985, thus preventing the destruction of Mondas. However, their efforts were thwarted by the Sixth Doctor and Peri Brown.",
        "The Doctor would later return to Antarctica in the 1970s during his fourth incarnation and, during his seventh incarnation, in 2006, 2012 and 2045.",
        "The Twelfth Doctor would return to Antarctica at the same time as the First Doctor when he was also on the verge of regenerating.",
        "Twenty years after they helped the Doctor prevent the return of Mondas in their personal timelines, Ben and Polly \u2014 who had gone their separate ways in life following their return to Earth on 20 July 1966 \u2014 reunited on 31 December 1986, which was by then their present.",
        "In the aftermath of the attempted Cyberman invasion, Professor Allison Williams led the scientific team which examined their ship.",
        "Unbeknownst to the Doctor, his regeneration into his second incarnation was witnessed by his deceased companion Oliver Harper, who was killed by the Vardans on Grace Alone but remained as a ghost in the TARDIS.",
        "Earth would again be threatened by the approach of a planet in or around the 2000s, in that case Gallifrey."

      "This was the final chronological appearance of William Hartnell as the First Doctor and introduced Patrick Troughton as the Second Doctor in the final moments of part four.",

      "William Hartnell returned to reprise the role of the First Doctor one final time in 1972-73's The Three Doctors for the opening of the tenth anniversary season of Doctor Who, but his poor health at the time of recording meant his appearances were reduced to pre-recorded video screen images."

The Doctor, Ben and Polly materialise outside the underground bunker and are soon spotted. They are interrogated and put in the observation room. A distress call is received from the Zeus IV space capsule which has been drawn off-course by an unknown force. The Doctor announces he knows the cause - a twin planet to Earth called Mondas has drifted back into the solar system and is draining Earth's energy. The Cybermen, inhabitants of Mondas, invade Snowcap and take control. Ben escapes and helps disable a Z-Bomb that could destroy Mondas. As Mondas burns up, the Cybermen die. The First Doctor collapses from old age and regenerates into the Second Doctor as Ben and Polly watch."
