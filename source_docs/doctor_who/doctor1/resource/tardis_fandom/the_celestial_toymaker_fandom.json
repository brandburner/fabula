The Toymaker forces them to play a series of games, with the threat that if they lose, they will become his playthings forever. They must navigate through challenges involving living dolls, chairs that can kill, and a TARDIS hopscotch game, all while the Doctor is trapped playing the Trilogic game against the Toymaker. In the end, the Doctor is able to defeat the Toymaker and escape with Steven and Dodo."
