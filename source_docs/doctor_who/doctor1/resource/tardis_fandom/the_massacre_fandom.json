Steven, meanwhile, is befriended by a group of Huguenots from the household of the Protestant Admiral de Coligny. Having rescued a young serving girl, Anne Chaplet, from some pursuing guards, the Huguenots gain their first inkling of a heinous plan being hatched at the command of the Catholic Queen Mother, Catherine de Medici."

No sooner has he done this but a servant girl, Anne Chaplet, runs into him before entering the tavern and is quickly followed by four guards. In the tavern, the girl hides, and because the guards are Catholics and the girl is a fellow Huguenot, Nicholas and his friends hide the girl from the guards, but only Steven is interested in why she was running. Because of Steven's interest, Nicholas questions Anne, and they learn that Anne had overheard the guards mention Wassy and \"It will happen again before the week is up\", implying another Huguenot massacre perpetrated by the Catholics."

When he gets to the house he bursts in and informs Nicholas of the location of the assassination and Nicholas runs off. On his way back from the Louvre, the Admiral approaches where the assassin lies in wait with a rifle. Nicholas and Steven make it to the Admiral, but not before the assassin fires a shot, wounding the Admiral in the arm."

      "plot_summary": "The next morning, Anne is hiding back at Preslin's shop, waiting for Steven to arrive. When Steven arrives, he informs her of the Doctor's death, still believing that he was pretending to be the Abbot. Telling her about the TARDIS key, the two begin to search for clothes in the shop, hoping that the Doctor had changed into the Abbot's garb at the shop and left the key with his clothes. The Doctor appears and tells them that this is not the case, much to the shock of Steven. The Doctor orders Anne to go to her aunt's house, despite the curfew. As soon as Anne has gone, the two make for the TARDIS. Once the curfew bell has rung, the Doctor and Steven leave in the TARDIS as the Massacre of St Bartholomew's Day commences."
