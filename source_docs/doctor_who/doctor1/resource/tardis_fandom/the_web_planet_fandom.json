        "Roslyn De Winter was hired to create the distinctive movements and stilted speech of the Menoptera. She was so successful that the production team asked her to take on the role of the Menoptera Vrestin.",
        "Despite not appearing and being uncredited on-screen for \"Escape to Danger\", Jacqueline Hill was still credited in Radio Times.",
        "Originally, the Zarbi had the ability to spit venom, but Dennis Spooner instead created smaller, grub-like creatures to fulfil this function.",
        "The music soundtrack, although from stock, is a highly unusual one, created by a group called Les Structures Sonor\u00e9s who produced music on glass tubes.",
        "In Bill Strutton's novelisation, the events of the story take place in the year 20,000. This was not derived from any information given in the televised version.",
        "To date, this is the only Doctor Who serial not to feature any humanoid characters in its supporting cast."

The Menoptera were driven from their home planet to a nearby moon, and they are now trying to reclaim Vortis. The Doctor and his companions get separated, and Barbara is enslaved by the Zarbi. Meanwhile, Ian teams up with a Menoptera named Vrestin to try and reach the Crater of Needles, where the enslaved Menoptera are forced to work. The Doctor and Vicki try to sabotage the Zarbi's operations from within their lair, the Carsinome, while Barbara and the other free Menoptera attempt to stop the Animus itself at the centre of the Carsinome. In the end, the Animus is destroyed, freeing the Zarbi from its control and allowing the Menoptera to reclaim their home planet."
