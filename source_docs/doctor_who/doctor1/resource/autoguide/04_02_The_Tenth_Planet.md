## Plot Summary

**Setting:** December 1986, at a South Pole Space Tracking Station under the command of General Cutler.

The serial begins with the Doctor, accompanied by companions Polly and Ben, arriving at a tracking station where a new planet, Mondas, has been discovered. As the station's crew grapples with the implications of this discovery, they soon learn that Mondas is the home of the Cybermen, a race of cybernetic beings intent on conquering Earth.

When the Cybermen attack the station, they capture the crew and attempt to use a Z-Bomb to obliterate Earth. The Doctor realizes that the Cybermen plan to use the bomb against Earth, leading to a tense standoff filled with suspense and confrontation.

In a climactic showdown, the Doctor cleverly outsmarts the Cybermen, but not without personal cost. His victory is accompanied by a transformative event that introduces the concept of regeneration, paving the way for the character of the Second Doctor, portrayed by Patrick Troughton.
