## Plot Summary
*The Myth Makers* is the third serial of the third season of *Doctor Who*, based on Homer's *Iliad*. The TARDIS lands outside the city of Troy, where the Doctor and his companions, Vicki and Steven, become embroiled in the events of the Trojan War. The Doctor is mistaken for Zeus by the Greek warrior Achilles and is taken to the Greek camp, where he is compelled to help Agamemnon and Odysseus plan an attack on Troy.

Meanwhile, Vicki and Steven are captured and taken by the Trojans, where they meet Katarina, a handmaiden to the prophetess Cassandra. The story unfolds with a mix of comedy and tragedy, as the Doctor must navigate the complexities of war while attempting not to alter the course of history. The Doctor and his companions face challenges, including battles and the eventual realization that they cannot prevent the impending destruction caused by the Greeks’ deceitful use of the Trojan Horse.

The serial showcases themes of fate, heroism, and the absurdities of war, culminating in a dramatic conclusion that leaves the Doctor with a new companion, Katarina, as they continue their travels through time and space.
