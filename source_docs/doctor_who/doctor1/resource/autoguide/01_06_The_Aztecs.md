Embracing this role, Barbara aims to abolish human sacrifices, believing that doing so could save the Aztecs from impending doom at the hands of Spanish colonizers.

Despite the First Doctor's stern warnings about the dangers of meddling with history, Barbara's resolve grows. She forges a bond with Autloc, the High Priest of Knowledge, who shares her vision of a better Aztec society. However, Tlotoxl, the High Priest of Sacrifice, becomes increasingly suspicious of Barbara and plots to expose her deception.

Meanwhile, Ian Chesterton finds himself conscripted into military service, facing off against the warrior Ixta, who is envious of Ian's rising influence. As tensions escalate, the Doctor inadvertently assists Ixta in defeating Ian, complicating their situation further.
