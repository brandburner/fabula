## Plot Summary
*"The Massacre"* is the fifth serial of the third season of *Doctor Who*, set in France during the turbulent events leading up to the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre in 1572. The narrative unfolds as the First Doctor and his companion Steven Taylor arrive in Paris, where they encounter pivotal historical figures including King Charles IX and Catherine de' Medici amidst rising tensions between the Huguenots and Catholics.

The serial intricately explores themes of fate and moral dilemmas, particularly concerning the Doctor's ability to intervene in historical events without altering the timeline. Ultimately, the Doctor chooses to step back, leading to tragic consequences that underscore the gravity of human conflicts and the impacts of political decisions.

Notable for its complete absence from the archives—no surviving footage exists—*The Massacre* is recognized as one of the most significant lost stories within the *Doctor Who* canon. Additionally, it marks the introduction of Jackie Lane as Dodo Chaplet, albeit in a limited capacity in the final episode, titled "Bell of Doom."
