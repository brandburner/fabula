## Plot Summary
The TARDIS lands on the planet Xeros, which has been transformed into a space museum exhibiting artifacts from across time and space. The Doctor and his companions—Ian Chesterton, Barbara Wright, and Vicki—discover that they are out of phase with time, making them invisible to the museum's inhabitants. They soon realize they are displayed as future exhibits and must change their fate before it becomes permanent.

As they explore the museum, they encounter various alien artifacts, including a Dalek, now reduced to a mere museum piece. The Doctor theorizes that the TARDIS has inadvertently jumped a time track, leading to their strange circumstances. The crew learns about the Morok invaders who have subjugated the Xerons, the planet's native inhabitants.

Vicki takes a leading role in aiding the Xerons in their rebellion against the Moroks, culminating in a successful revolt. As time resolves itself, they are no longer out of phase, allowing them to interact with the Xerons directly. The travelers depart Xeros, confident that they have altered the dire future they witnessed.
