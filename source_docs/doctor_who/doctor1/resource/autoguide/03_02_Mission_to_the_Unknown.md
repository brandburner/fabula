As Cory investigates their surroundings, he uncovers the sinister plans of the Daleks, who are plotting universal domination. The narrative unfolds as Cory strives to send a warning back to Earth regarding the imminent Dalek threat. Meanwhile, Jeff Garvey (Barry Jackson) descends into violence under the influence of the Varga plant, a dangerous native species. In a heartbreaking turn, Cory is forced to shoot Garvey, who begins to transform into a Varga himself.
