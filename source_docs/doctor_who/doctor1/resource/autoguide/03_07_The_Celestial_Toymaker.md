## Plot Summary
*The Celestial Toymaker* is the seventh serial of the third season of *Doctor Who*. In this serial, the First Doctor, along with his companions Steven Taylor and Dodo Chaplet, finds themselves trapped in the realm of the Celestial Toymaker, a powerful alien intelligence. The Toymaker separates the Doctor from Steven and Dodo, forcing them to engage in a series of seemingly innocent yet deadly games. Each game they play is not only a test of skill but also of their very lives.

As the plot unfolds, Steven and Dodo must navigate various challenges, including the Trilogic Game, where they must outsmart the Toymaker to reunite with the Doctor. The games are whimsical yet dangerous, filled with characters such as the King and Queen of Hearts, who add to the surreal and perilous atmosphere. Meanwhile, the Doctor is trying to outwit the Toymaker to rescue his friends.

Only the last episode, "The Final Test," is preserved in the BBC archives, while the first three episodes are missing. The story has been novelized and was released in animated form in 2024.
