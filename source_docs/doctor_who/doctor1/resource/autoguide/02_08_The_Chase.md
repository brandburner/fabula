5. **Similar Storytelling Style:** "The Chase" shares a narrative structure with "The Keys of Marinus," involving the TARDIS team traveling to different locations in each episode.

9. **Cultural References:** The serial features cultural references, such as a scene involving a Beatles song, which had to be edited out of American releases due to licensing issues.
