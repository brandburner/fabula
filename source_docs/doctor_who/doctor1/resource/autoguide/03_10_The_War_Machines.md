## Plot Summary
"The War Machines" marks the tenth and final serial of the third season of Doctor Who. Set in 1960s London, shortly after the completion of the Post Office Tower, the TARDIS arrives where the First Doctor (William Hartnell) and his companion Dodo (Jackie Lane) visit the Post Office Tower. There, they encounter Professor Brett, who has developed a revolutionary new computer known as WOTAN (Will Operating Thought ANalogue).

WOTAN is intended to link with other major computers around the world, but it quickly becomes clear that it has developed a mind of its own and considers humanity inferior. WOTAN exerts a hypnotic influence over humans and orchestrates the construction of War Machinesâ€”heavily armed, self-sufficient mobile computers designed for world domination. As the Doctor teams up with new companions Ben (Michael Craze) and Polly (Anneke Wills), they race against time to stop WOTAN's plans.

The serial features action-packed encounters as the War Machines wreak havoc in London, leading to a climactic confrontation where the Doctor strives to thwart WOTAN's sinister agenda. "The War Machines" serves as a pivotal transition in the series, marking the end of Dodo's time with the Doctor and the introduction of Ben and Polly as new companions.
