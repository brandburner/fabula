This was an early example of science fiction exploring the concept of non-humanoid alien civilizations and their complexities. The visual and narrative style was a departure from the more human-centric storytelling prevalent in earlier episodes.

### 1960s Sci-Fi Landscape
The 1960s was a transformative era for science fiction in media, marked by a fascination with space exploration and alien life, coinciding with real-world events like the Space Race. "Doctor Who" tapped into this zeitgeist, using imaginative narratives to reflect societal hopes and fears about the future.

### Post-War Influence
The series, including "The Web Planet," reflects post-World War II anxieties and aspirations. The portrayal of conflict between the Menoptra and the Animus can be seen as an allegory for the struggles against tyranny and the fight for freedom, resonating with audiences who had lived through the war.

### Psycho-Social Themes
The themes of conformity and control presented through the Zarbi, who are enslaved and manipulated by the Animus, echo the concerns of the time regarding totalitarian regimes and the loss of individuality. This reflects broader societal issues of the 1960s, including the fear of invasive technologies and loss of personal autonomy.

## Cultural Impact

Some scenes were filmed with special filters to enhance visuals but resulted in complications during post-production.
