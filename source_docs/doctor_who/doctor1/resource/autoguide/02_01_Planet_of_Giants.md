## Plot Summary
In "Planet of Giants," the First Doctor and his companions—Susan, Ian, and Barbara—find themselves in contemporary England after the TARDIS malfunctions during a time jump. The crew is accidentally shrunk to the size of an inch, leading them to navigate a garden that appears gigantic from their miniaturized perspective. They encounter various hazards, including a normal-sized ant and the threat posed by a deadly insecticide being developed by a local businessman, Smithers. The story, inspired by Rachel Carson's "Silent Spring," serves as an environmental cautionary tale against the dangers of pesticides and human impact on nature.
