It's an ambitious project that highlights the possibilities for historical adventure. The story features a fine cast, including Julian Glover, marking the first flowering of Doctor Who's guest-star policy. Despite some misogyny, the script avoids racism and presents Arabic culture with integrity.",
    "bottom_line": "An ambitious project which highlights the possibilities for historical adventure. Imaginative, with a fine cast and a very adult storyline. Despite a dose of misogyny (with torture and beatings on-screen), the script manages to avoid racism, presenting Arabic culture with integrity."
