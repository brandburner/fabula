## Plot Summary
"Spearhead from Space" introduces the Third Doctor, portrayed by Jon Pertwee, who has just regenerated following the events of "The War Games." Set in Essex and London, the Doctor finds himself exiled to Earth by the Time Lords. He teams up with Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart and scientist Liz Shaw to combat an invasion from the Nestenes, an alien consciousness that controls plastic.

The story begins with meteorites crashing to Earth, and the Doctor, unconscious and disoriented, is discovered outside the TARDIS. As he struggles to regain his memory and powers, UNIT investigates the meteorite landings and discovers a link to the Autons—plastic beings that can take human forms and are used by the Nestenes to infiltrate Earth.

The Doctor must navigate this perilous situation, utilizing his intellect and resourcefulness to thwart the Autons' plan. The climax culminates in a tense confrontation where the Doctor and UNIT race against time to prevent the Nestenes from overtaking Earth, testing the Doctor's ingenuity and bravery.

This serial is significant not only for its introduction of the Third Doctor but also for setting a new tone in Doctor Who's storytelling, emphasizing darker themes and Earth-based adventures.
