## Plot Summary
"Carnival of Monsters" marks the second serial of the tenth season of *Doctor Who*, featuring the Third Doctor and his companion Jo Grant. The story unfolds as the TARDIS, intended to transport them to Metebelis Three, instead lands on the SS Bernice, a ship that has mysteriously vanished while sailing in the Indian Ocean.

Onboard, the Doctor and Jo discover that the crew and passengers are trapped in a time loop, repeating their actions without awareness of previous encounters. They encounter a strange hatch that leads them to the Miniscope, a device operated by the showman Vorg, who captures and displays various life forms for entertainment.

As they navigate this bizarre scenario, the Doctor and Jo find themselves trapped within the Miniscope alongside various monstrous creatures, including the Drashigs. They must escape while unraveling the mystery behind Vorg's carnival of monsters. The plot weaves themes of captivity, ethics of entertainment, and the nature of reality, culminating in a thrilling conclusion where the Doctor confronts his captors and returns to the TARDIS with Jo.

This serial is notable for its engaging narrative and imaginative creatures, and it signifies a pivotal moment in the series, being the first since "The War Games" where the Doctor pilots the TARDIS entirely on his own.
