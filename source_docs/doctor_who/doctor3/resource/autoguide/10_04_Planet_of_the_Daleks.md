## Plot Summary
The story begins with the Third Doctor recovering from a gunshot wound inflicted by the Master. He is in a coma inside the TARDIS, which has landed on the planet Spiridon. Jo Grant, the Doctor's companion, manages to leave the TARDIS to seek help. She encounters a group of Thals, who are long-standing adversaries of the Daleks.

The Thals rescue the Doctor, who is in critical condition due to a deadly fungus that has overrun the TARDIS. The Thals explain that the Daleks have established a research facility on Spiridon, where they are attempting to create an army of Daleks. The Doctor and Jo, along with the Thals, must navigate through the Dalek stronghold and confront the threat posed by the Daleks, who are plotting to awaken their dormant forces.

As the story unfolds, there are various encounters with the Daleks, and the Doctor must devise a plan to thwart their intentions. The climax of the story revolves around the suspense of whether the Doctor and his allies can stop the Daleks from unleashing their army upon the universe once again.

The serial is a continuation of the overarching narrative that began with the previous serial, "Frontier in Space," marking a significant moment in the Doctor Who saga, showcasing the Doctor's enduring battle against one of his most iconic foes, the Daleks.

## Cultural Context
"Planet of the Daleks" is a significant serial in the "Doctor Who" franchise, first broadcast in six parts from April 7 to May 12, 1973. It represents an essential moment in the series, being the first Dalek story written by their creator Terry Nation since "The Daleks' Master Plan" in 1965, highlighting the enduring popularity and cultural impact of the Daleks, one of the show's most iconic villains.

### Historical Context:
1. **Political Climate of the 1970s:** The early 1970s in the UK were marked by political turmoil, economic challenges, and a growing interest in science fiction as a genre that addressed contemporary fears about technology and war. "Doctor Who," through stories like "Planet of the Daleks," reflected these anxieties, with the Daleks serving as allegorical representations of totalitarian regimes and the dangers of unchecked technological advancement.

2. **Evolution of Television:** "Planet of the Daleks" was produced during a time when British television was experimenting with special effects and storytelling techniques. The serial employed innovative production methods, including the introduction of new Dalek props that deviated from the original designs of the 1960s. This evolution showcased the show's commitment to maintaining relevance and visual appeal in a rapidly changing media landscape.

3. **Cultural Impact of the Daleks:** The Daleks quickly became synonymous with "Doctor Who" and British pop culture, representing the archetype of the villainous alien. Their catchphrase, "Exterminate!" became ingrained in popular language, symbolizing the show's influence on British culture and its ability to critique moral and ethical dilemmas through science fiction.

### Real-World References:
1. **Environmental Themes:** The narrative involves the planet Spiridon, where the Daleks seek to exploit the native inhabitants' ability to become invisible. This theme can be seen as a commentary on environmental exploitation and colonialism, reflecting real-world issues of the 1970s concerning nature, biodiversity, and the consequences of human intervention in ecosystems.

2. **Feminist Elements:** Jo Grant, played by Katy Manning, serves as the Doctor's companion and plays a vital role in the story. Her character reflects the evolving portrayal of women in television during the 1970s, showcasing strength, intelligence, and agency, which aligned with the feminist movements of the time.

3. **Cinematic Influences:** The serial's jungle setting and visual aesthetics drew inspiration from various cinematic tropes, showcasing both science fiction and adventure genres. The portrayal of the Spiridon landscape can be likened to contemporary films exploring exotic locations, indicating the influence of cinema on television storytelling.

Overall, "Planet of the Daleks" stands as a testament to the cultural and historical significance of "Doctor Who," encapsulating the series' ability to address pressing societal issues while entertaining audiences. The enduring legacy of the Daleks continues to resonate with fans, further solidifying their place in the annals of science fiction history.

## Production Notes
### Production Challenges:
The story was initially commissioned under the title "Planet of the Daleks," but during production, it briefly changed to "Destination: Daleks." Episodes 2 & 4 do not feature a reprise of the previous episode's cliffhanger ending, while the reprises in Episodes 3 and 5 are re-performances. This technique was uncommon at the time. The Dalek Supreme was a modified prop from the film "Daleks' Invasion Earth: 2150 A.D." The eyestalk was replaced with a conventional torch that flashed when it spoke.

For many years, Episode 3 existed in the BBC Archives only as a black-and-white 16mm telerecording as the original color transmission master was wiped. It was later restored to full color using computer colorization techniques and released on DVD in 2009. The production went over-budget by £13,000, which impacted future directing opportunities for Andrew Morgan.

### Filming Locations:
- Theed Street, Southwark, London (Final confrontation with the Supreme Dalek)
- Wootton Street, Southwark, London (Imperial and Renegade Dalek battle)
- Braybrook Street, East Acton, London (Conversations between the Doctor and Jo)
- Windmill Walk, Southwark, London (Jo and the Doctor running away)
- Kew Bridge Steam Museum, Brentford, Middlesex (Foreman's Yard)
- Willesden Lane Cemetery, Willesden, London
- BBC Television Centre (TC8), Shepherd's Bush, London

### Special Effects:
The serial featured several special effects, including the use of Daleks, which were created through practical effects. The use of models and filming techniques was essential, particularly for scenes involving the Dalek army. The production utilized a combination of computer-generated effects and traditional practical effects to enhance the visual storytelling.

### Overall Challenges:
The production faced difficulties due to location shooting, particularly for scenes involving the Daleks in cold environments. This required careful planning and execution to ensure the safety of the actors and the integrity of the props, especially the Dalek operators who had to navigate challenging terrains.

This comprehensive overview of the production details offers insight into the challenges and creative solutions that shaped "Planet of the Daleks."
