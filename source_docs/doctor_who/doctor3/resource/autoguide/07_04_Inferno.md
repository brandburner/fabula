## Plot Summary
In "Inferno," the Third Doctor becomes embroiled in a high-stakes project known as Inferno, which aims to drill deep into the Earth's crust to access a new energy source. However, as drilling progresses, a catastrophic event occurs, unleashing dire consequences that threaten not only the Earth but also an alternate universe where the Doctor finds himself trapped.

The Doctor attempts to warn the team—led by Professor Stahlman—about the potentially disastrous ramifications of their actions. His warnings, however, fall on deaf ears, leading to his imprisonment by the military of the alternate universe, who refuse to believe him. As tensions rise, the Doctor must race against time to avert disaster while confronting the monstrous Primords, beings transformed by the drilling process.

The narrative intricately explores themes of parallel universes, the consequences of unchecked scientific ambition, and the moral dilemmas faced by those in positions of power.
