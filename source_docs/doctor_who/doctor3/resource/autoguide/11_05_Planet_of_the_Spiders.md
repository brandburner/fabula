## Plot Summary
"Planet of the Spiders" is the fifth and final serial of the 11th season of the British science fiction television series *Doctor Who*. This six-episode serial features the Third Doctor investigating a meditation center run by a group of transcendental chanters who are unknowingly in contact with a malevolent alien race known as the Eight Legs, or giant spiders.
