## Plot Summary
The Monster of Peladon is set on the mineral-rich planet Peladon, fifty years after the events of *The Curse of Peladon*. The planet is ruled by Queen Thalira, the daughter of the late King Peladon. The Doctor and his companion Sarah Jane Smith arrive to find the Galactic Federation in turmoil as an influential council convenes amidst a power struggle between miners and the aristocracy.

As tensions escalate, the rogue engineer Eckersley, in collusion with Ice Warrior Commander Azaxyr, plots to seize control of Peladon to sell its precious trisilicate to enemies residing in Galaxy Five.
