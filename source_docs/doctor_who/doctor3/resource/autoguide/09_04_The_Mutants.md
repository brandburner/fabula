## Plot Summary:
Set in the 30th century, the Earth Empire is undergoing contraction, leading to the decision to decolonize the planet Solos. The Marshal of Solos schemes to alter the planet's atmosphere to make it breathable for humans while rendering it inhospitable for the native Solonians. The Third Doctor arrives on Solos, armed with tablets containing crucial information about the Solonians' unique life cycle.

As the Doctor, accompanied by his companion Jo Grant, becomes embroiled in the political machinations of the Marshal, they uncover the dire ramifications of the Marshal's oppressive plans. The narrative deftly explores themes of colonialism and social justice, drawing parallels to real-world issues such as apartheid.

Throughout the episodes, the Doctor aids the Solonians in their struggle against the oppressive regime while uncovering their transformative life cycle—akin to a butterfly's metamorphosis—which becomes central to resolving the conflict. Partnering with local allies such as Ky and Sondergaard, they navigate the treacherous political landscape, ultimately fighting for the Solonians' right to exist free from oppression.
