In the village of Devil's End, an archaeological dig is uncovering the infamous Devil's Hump, a Bronze Age burial mound. A local white witch, Olive Hawthorne, arrives to protest, warning of great evil and the coming of the horned beast, but her warnings are dismissed as the ramblings of a crank. Meanwhile, The Master awakens the ancient horned alien Azal in a cavern beneath the church, intending to harness Azal's immense powers for his own nefarious purposes.
