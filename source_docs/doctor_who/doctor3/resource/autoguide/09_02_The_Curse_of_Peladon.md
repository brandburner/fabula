## Plot Summary
Set on the mineral-rich planet of Peladon, this story follows the young King Peladon as he prepares to join the Galactic Federation. The High Priest Hepesh opposes this decision, invoking the curse of Aggedor, the Royal Beast of Peladon, to instill fear among the populace. The Doctor and Jo arrive in the midst of this political turmoil and become entangled in the machinations surrounding the Federation's delegates.

As the conference progresses, the Doctor uncovers sabotage attempts threatening the proceedings. The Ice Warriors, once adversaries, are now among the delegates, complicating the political landscape. The Doctor's investigations reveal the true nature of the curse and the conspiracies at work, culminating in a confrontation with Hepesh and the revelation of Aggedor's true nature.

The narrative serves as an allegory for contemporary political issues, exploring themes of progress versus preservation and the clash between tradition and modernization. Characters navigate a landscape filled with fear, deception, and hope, striving for a resolution that benefits the people of Peladon.

Hepesh's character resonates with those opposed to the UK's entry into the EEC. Additionally, the portrayal of alien delegates reflects the anxieties and aspirations surrounding international collaboration.

### Themes of Superstition and Tradition
The narrative's reliance on the curse of Aggedor illustrates how superstition can impede political decisions. This theme critiques the role of fear and ignorance in obstructing progress, urging viewers to consider the importance of rational discourse in politics.

### Representation of Women
