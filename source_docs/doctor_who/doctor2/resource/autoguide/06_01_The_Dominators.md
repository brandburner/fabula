## Plot Summary
*The Dominators* is the first serial of the sixth season of the British science fiction television series *Doctor Who*. The story begins with the TARDIS landing on the peaceful planet of Dulkis. The Second Doctor, along with his companions Jamie and Zoe, soon discovers that the planet is under threat from the ruthless Dominators, who have arrived in an alien spacecraft.

The Dominators, led by Rago and accompanied by his subordinate Toba, employ robotic beings known as Quarks to carry out their nefarious plans. These Quarks are sent to bore holes into the planetâ€™s crust in order to convert Dulkis into rocket fuel for their own destructive purposes. The Doctor and his companions must work alongside the planet's inhabitants, known as Dulcians, to thwart the Dominators' plot before they can destroy the planet.
