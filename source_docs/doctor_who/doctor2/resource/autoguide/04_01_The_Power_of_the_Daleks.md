## Plot Summary
Following his regeneration, the new Doctor regains consciousness, sets the TARDIS in flight, and appears to deliberately misunderstand direct questions from Ben and Polly. While Ben suspects him to be an imposter, Polly is willing to believe he is the same man. The TARDIS lands on the planet Vulcan, where the Doctor witnesses the murder of an examiner from Earth, sent to inspect the planet's colony. The Doctor, using the dead man's badge, pretends to be the examiner. A security team, led by Bragen, escorts the Doctor, Ben, and Polly to the colony, where they meet the governor, Hensell, and his deputy, Quinn. There are indications of a rebel faction that Hensell does not take seriously.

The Doctor and his companions learn about a two-century-old capsule discovered by the colony's scientist, Lesterson. The Doctor sneaks into the laboratory, followed by Ben and Polly, where they discover two Daleks inside the capsule, with a third missing. The group is discovered by Lesterson; the Doctor inquires about the third Dalek, and the scientist reports that he hid what he assumed was a machine, with the intention to reactivate it.

Later, Lesterson and his assistants manage to revive the Dalek, and Lesterson removes its gun stick after one of the assistants, Resno, is killed. Quinn, revealed as the one who summoned the examiner, is accused by Bragen of sabotage and is arrested, with his position then assigned to Bragen. The Doctor, Ben, and Polly witness these events, during which Lesterson arrives with the reactivated Dalek, which feigns loyalty. The Doctor remains suspicious and verbally hostile to the Dalek, who recognizes the Doctor, finally convincing Ben that he is indeed the same man. Lesterson reactivates the other two Daleks and removes their guns.

This episode is significant as it features the first full story with Patrick Troughton as the Second Doctor and explores themes of power, loyalty, and deception through interactions with the Daleks.
