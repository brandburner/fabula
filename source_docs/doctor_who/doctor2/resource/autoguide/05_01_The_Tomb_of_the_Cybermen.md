## Plot Summary
*The Tomb of the Cybermen* is the first serial of the fifth season of the British science fiction television series *Doctor Who*. The story begins with the Second Doctor (Patrick Troughton) and his companions Jamie (Frazer Hines) and Victoria (Deborah Watling) arriving on the planet Telos. They soon encounter an Earth archaeological expedition led by Professor Parry (Aubrey Richards), which aims to unearth the fabled tombs of the Cybermen, a long-extinct race of cybernetic beings.

The expedition is financially backed by Eric Klieg (George Pastell), who harbors his own ambitions to harness the power of the Cybermen. Kaftan (Shirley Cooklin), the expedition's assistant, is also keen to exploit the Cybermen's technology. As the team breaks into the tombs, they inadvertently awaken the dormant Cybermen, who are revived and begin to threaten the lives of the expedition members.

As the Doctor and his companions navigate the dangers posed by the Cybermen and the treachery within the expedition, they must find a way to seal the tombs again before the Cybermen can escape and wreak havoc on the universe. The story culminates in a tense confrontation between the Doctor and the Cyber Controller, showcasing themes of ambition, greed, and the perils of tampering with forces beyond human understanding.
