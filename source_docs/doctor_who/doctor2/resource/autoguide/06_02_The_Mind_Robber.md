## Plot Summary
"The Mind Robber" is the second serial of the sixth season of the British science fiction television series *Doctor Who*. It is set outside of time and space in a realm inhabited by fictional characters and mythological beings, such as Medusa, the Minotaur, and the Unicorn. Following the Doctor's (Patrick Troughton) defeat of the Dominators and the subsequent eruption of a volcano, the TARDIS is thrown into this world.

The Doctor, along with his companions Jamie McCrimmon (Frazer Hines) and Zoe Heriot (Wendy Padbury), finds themselves in a white void known as the Land of Fiction. Here, they encounter various characters and must solve challenges presented by the English fiction writer known as "the Master" (Emrys Jones), who seeks to recruit the Doctor as the new creative force in this fantastical land.

As the narrative unfolds, Jamie and Zoe are separated from the Doctor and face perilous situations. The Doctor confronts a psychic assault and grapples with the nature of fiction and reality while trying to rescue his companions. The serial explores themes of creativity, identity, and the power of storytelling, ultimately leading to a confrontation with the Master and a bid for the Doctor's own identity as a fictional character.

The episode is notable for its imaginative scenarios and for pushing the boundaries of narrative within the science fiction genre.
