## Plot Summary
"The Krotons" follows the Second Doctor and his companions, Jamie and Zoe, as they arrive on a barren planet inhabited by the Gond race. The Gonds are subjugated by the Krotons, a race of crystalline aliens who have maintained control over them for centuries. Each year, the Krotons select the brightest Gonds to serve them, a process cloaked in a facade of honor that ultimately leads to the candidates being drained of their mental energy and killed.

As the Doctor, Jamie, and Zoe delve deeper into the Gonds' plight, they uncover the true nature of the Krotons’ control and the grim fate that befalls the chosen ones. The Doctor strives to liberate the Gonds from the Krotons' tyranny, emphasizing themes of rebellion against oppressive authority, the significance of knowledge, and the necessity for critical thought in the face of manipulation.

The serial explores the dynamics between the Krotons and the Gonds, showcasing the dangers of blindly following authority. Through clever dialogue and dramatic encounters, the Doctor and his companions engage in a battle of wits and resilience against their alien captors, ultimately aiming to restore freedom and self-determination to the Gond people.
