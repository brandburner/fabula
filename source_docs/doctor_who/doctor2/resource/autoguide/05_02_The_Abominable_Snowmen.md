## Plot Summary
In this six-part adventure set in 1935 Tibet, the Second Doctor, along with his companions Jamie and Victoria, arrive at the Det-Sen monastery to return a holy relic.

The Doctor, Jamie, and Victoria become embroiled in a battle to uncover the mystery behind the Yeti's transformation and thwart the Great Intelligence's plans for conquest. They ally with Professor Edward Travers, who has his own connections to the Yeti and knowledge of their origins. The story unfolds with a series of encounters with the Yeti and a race against time as they attempt to save the monastery and the planet from the impending threat.
