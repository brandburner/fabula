The colonists refuse to heed the Doctor's warnings that the Daleks are dangerous. Once reactivated, the Daleks begin performing duties around the colony and a rebel group plots to use them to gain power. But the Daleks have sinister plans of their own."

The Daleks eventually overpower the colony's defenses and launch an all-out assault, but the Doctor is able to sabotage their power source, destroying the Daleks. However, the colony is left in a state of disarray following the attack."
