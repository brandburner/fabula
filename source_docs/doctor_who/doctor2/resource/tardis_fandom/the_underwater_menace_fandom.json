        "Only episodes two and three of this four-part story exist in the BBC Archives as 16mm black & white film telerecordings.",
        "Episode one of this story has Jamie's 'bigger on the inside' moment, as he isn't actually shown inside the TARDIS in The Highlanders.",
        "Episode one of this serial concludes a run of twelve missing episodes, which begins with episode four of The Tenth Planet.",
        "At the end of episode three, Professor Zaroff utters the timeless line, 'Nothing in the world can stop me now!'",
        "According to Anneke Wills on the DVD commentary, the main cast didn't get on with director Julia Smith.",
        "In the opening TARDIS scene, Polly, Ben and the Doctor are each heard 'thinking' about where they would like to land next in a rare example of internal monologue.",
        "Zaroff was at one point assisted by a female scientist called Steen. Originally, there was a character named Ebon, but it was then decided to merge her with Ara.",
        "In an early draft of the story, Zaroff's motivation to blow up the Earth stemmed from his being driven mad by the deaths of his wife and children in a car crash.",
        "The scene of Polly about to be operated on to be turned into a fish person sparked an angry letter from Mrs N Safford, of the National Society for the Welfare of Children in Hospitals, who was concerned that it would scare children with upcoming surgeries."

The travellers are captured and taken into the depths of the Earth, where they find a hidden civilisation \u2014 the lost city of Atlantis. The Atlanteans worship a goddess named Amdo and use fish people to farm the plankton-based food on which they survive. A deranged scientist, Professor Zaroff, has convinced them that he can raise their city from the sea, but actually, he plans to drain the ocean into the Earth's molten core so that the resultant superheated steam will cause the planet to explode. The travellers meet up with two shipwreck survivors, Sean and Jacko, who persuade the fish people to rebel and stop work. The Doctor eventually foils Zaroff's plan, but only by breaking down the sea walls and flooding the city. Zaroff drowns, but everyone else escapes."

The Doctor tricks Zaroff into sparing their lives. In episode two, the Doctor discovers Zaroff's true plan to drain the oceans and destroy the Earth. The travellers rescue Polly from being turned into a fish person and join forces with shipwrecked survivors Sean and Jacko to sabotage Zaroff's operation. In episode three, the Doctor and Ramo confront Thous, the leader of Atlantis, but Zaroff murders Thous and takes control. The Doctor captures Zaroff but he escapes. In episode four, the Doctor floods Atlantis to stop Zaroff, who drowns as the city is destroyed."
