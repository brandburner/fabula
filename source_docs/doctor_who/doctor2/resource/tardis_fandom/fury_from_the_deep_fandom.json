The Doctor is able to use Victoria's screams to destroy the weed creature, but Victoria decides to stay with the Harris family rather than return to the TARDIS."

They discover that the weed creature can control people's minds and is sabotaging the gas pipeline network. The Doctor tries to find the creature's 'nerve centre' in order to destroy it. Victoria is kidnapped by the controlled Robson, but the Doctor and Jamie are able to rescue her. They then confront the weed creature at the central control rig and use Victoria's screams to defeat it, allowing the crew to be freed from its control."
