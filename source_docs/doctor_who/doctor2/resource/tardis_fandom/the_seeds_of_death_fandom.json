        "The working title for this story was The Lords of the Red Planet.",

        "This is the only story to feature footage of an Ice Warrior on location, where in episode four an Ice Warrior was filmed on Hampstead Heath in London.",
        "Brian Hayles' scripts differed from his story breakdown in several respects.",
        "Patrick Troughton does not appear in episode four as he was on holiday during the week it was recorded.",
        "The footage of the rocket in episode five is stock material of Mariner 4, a mission launched in 1964 to map the surface of Mars.",
        "The footage of the rocket launch in episode six is also library footage, from a Soviet launch in 1948 of a R-1 missile, a short-range copy of the German V-2.",
        "A subplot in episodes three and four in which Kelly was mind-controlled by the Ice Warriors was removed.",
        "Episode five exists in its original broadcast format due to it being preserved as a 35mm film negative.",
        "It was originally planned to have four standard Ice Warrior costumes available, but this was reduced to three in order to cut costs."
