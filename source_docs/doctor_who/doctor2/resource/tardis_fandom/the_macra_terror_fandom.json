Yet a shadowy presence soon makes them realise that the surface contentment is carefully controlled. The colony's inhabitants have been brainwashed by giant, crab-like creatures \u2014 the Macra. Insidious propaganda, broadcast by the Controller, forces the humans to mine a gas that is essential for the Macra to survive, but fatal to them. The Doctor and his team are up against it, particularly when Ben falls under the influence of the Macra. Can they destroy the gas pumping equipment and get rid of the Macra for good?"
