    {

Jamie contacts a nearby space station known as the Wheel and they are rescued. Meanwhile, the Silver Carrier discharges Cybermats, which also travel to and enter the station. These pave the way for the invasion of the station by Cybermen, who intend to use its direct radio link with Earth as a beacon for their invasion fleet. The Doctor sends Jamie and Zoe Heriot over to the Silver Carrier to fetch the TARDIS's vector generator rod. Meanwhile, he frees the Wheel's crew from the Cybermen's hypnotic control and aims to destroy all the Cybermen on the station. When Jamie and Zoe return, the Doctor installs the rod in the station's X-ray laser, making it powerful enough to destroy the Cyber-fleet. An approaching force of space-walking Cybermen is also vanquished."
