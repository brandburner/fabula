        "The script \u2014 under the name The Space Trap (without hyphen, as here) \u2014 was actually commissioned for delivery in 1969, probably for the penultimate story of Season 6.",
        "However, because Holmes had completed the scripts early, the story went into production in late 1968 when a Dick Sharples story, Prison in Space, fell by the wayside.",
        "Episode one exists as a 35mm black-and-white film negative, while the others exist as 16mm film negatives.",
        "As of today, this story has the most title-drops of any Doctor Who story, at 72."

The Krotons are in suspended animation, in a crystalline slurry form, awaiting a time when they can be reconstituted by absorption of mental energy. Periodically, the two most brilliant Gond students are received into the Dynatrope, nominally to become \"companions of the Krotons\", but in truth to have their mental energy drained, after which they are killed. When the Second Doctor and Zoe take the students' test, their mental power is sufficient to reanimate the Krotons. The Doctor discovers that their life system is based on tellurium. With help from the Gond scientist Beta, he destroys them and their ship with an impure form of sulphuric acid."
