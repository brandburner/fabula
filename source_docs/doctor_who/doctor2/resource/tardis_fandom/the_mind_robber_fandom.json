The travellers find themselves in an endless void where they are menaced by white robots. Having regained the safety of the TARDIS, they believe they have escaped \u2014 until the ship explodes. They find themselves in a land of fiction, where they are hunted by life-size clockwork soldiers and encounter characters like Rapunzel, the Karkus, and Swift's Lemuel Gulliver. This domain is presided over by a man known only as the Master \u2014 a prolific English writer from 1926 \u2014 who in turn is controlled by a Master Brain computer. The Doctor engages the Master in a battle of wills using fictional characters. Zoe and Jamie overload the Master Brain, freeing the Master. In the confusion, the White Robots destroy the computer, returning the travellers to reality."
