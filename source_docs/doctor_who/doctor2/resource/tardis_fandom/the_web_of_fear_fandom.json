It arrives in the London Underground railway system, the tunnels of which are being overrun by the mysterious web, produced by the Great Intelligence's robot Yeti. The time travellers learn this crisis was precipitated when Professor Travers, whom they first met in the Himalayas some thirty years earlier, accidentally caused one of the Yeti to be reactivated, opening the way for the Intelligence to invade again. The travellers work alongside army forces \u2014 led initially by Captain Knight, and then by Colonel Lethbridge-Stewart \u2014 as they battle the alien menace, hampered by one of their number under the Intelligence's influence acting as a traitor in their midst."
