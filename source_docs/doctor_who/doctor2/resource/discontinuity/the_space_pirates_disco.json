The Space Corps enforce law and order in an area where pirates also steal shipments of argonite ore. Argonite mining is almost always done by large companies, including the Issigri Mining Company [which later became the Interplanetary Mining Corporation].",

Despite this, it is possible to see the first real emergence of Robert Holmes' gift for characterisation and engaging plot."
