Hovercraft, helicopters and intercontinental rocket transport are all commonplace. Public telephones and holiday liners still exist.

    "bottom_line": "Griffin the chef is wonderful \u2013 it's a pity we don't see more of this most ordinary person in Doctor Who \u2013 and Benik is the campest character in Who, a much more contested award. The story is edited really badly, so characters leap from scene to scene interrupting each other. Troughton's fun villainy apart, it all feels rather irrelevant."
