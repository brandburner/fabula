Scottish Highland clans, loyal to Bonnie Prince Charles Edward, battle with the English and German regiments loyal to the English monarch, King George. Finally overpowered by superior forces, the Highlanders break ranks and leave the battlefield. The leader of Clan McLaren, Colin, is badly injured. His son Alexander, daughter Kirsty and a young piper called Jamie McCrimmon, accompany him. Confronted on the path by two Redcoats, Alexander engages the soldiers in a sword fight. He kills one Redcoat and the other flees, allowing the small group to move on seeking refuge. The Tardis materialises in small hollow, concealed from view by bushes and brambles. Ben comes out, followed by Polly and the Doctor."
