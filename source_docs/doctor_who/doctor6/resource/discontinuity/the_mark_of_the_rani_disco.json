    "bottom_line": "A script with a simple plot, a Doctorish Doctor, and whimsy rather than sadism, quite a novelty in this season. The dialogue's overblown, but the concept of the Rani mocking the ridiculous Master/Doctor rivalry is wonderful. The Doctor's inspection of the inside of the Rani's TARDIS is one of the few great scenes of this era. Both the direction and the music are superb, though the interiors look oddly artificial. Altogether rather more impressive than its reputation."
