    "bottom_line": "It looks wonderful and the plot is just about consistent and straightforward. The lack of involvement of the Doctor (and the Daleks!) is startling, showing that Eric Saward is once again more interested in telling mercenary stories, but at least this one's interesting and well played. William Gaunt scores hugely for playing against the pathetic and cynical nature of his lines, managing to make Orcini genuinely noble instead of merely a paper tiger. Alexei Sayle surprises by being sweet and subtle (and one of the few sentient life forms in the galaxy who doesn't want to molest Peri) and the Doctor finally gets to be Doctorish, with proper doses of compassion. Quite promising for the future, really."
