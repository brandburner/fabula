## Plot Summary
In the 19th-century mining village of Killingworth, North East England, during the time of the Luddite uprisings, The Sixth Doctor and his companion Peri Brown arrive in the midst of chaos. They encounter brainwashed miners who are violently attacking machinery in a rebellion against the encroaching industrialization.

Caught within this turmoil are two Time Lords: the manipulative Master and the scientifically driven Rani. The Rani is conducting cruel experiments aimed at harvesting chemicals from the brains of humans for her nefarious purposes, while the Master has ambitions to exploit Earth's brightest minds to establish a new stronghold.

The Doctor is drawn into the conflict, striving to restore order and save the villagers from the devastating consequences of the Rani and Master's schemes. He must devise a plan to counteract the mind-controlling parasitic agents that the Master has unleashed. Throughout the adventure, themes of exploitation, labor rights, and the ethical boundaries of scientific exploration are interwoven, culminating in a battle of wits against the Time Lords.
