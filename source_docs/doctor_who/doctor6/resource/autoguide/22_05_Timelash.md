As the Doctor investigates, he discovers that the Borad has undergone a horrific transformation, becoming a monstrous, disfigured being due to the misuse of the Timelash to manipulate time itself. The Borad's attempts to eliminate his enemies intertwine with the return of the Master, who has his own sinister plans against the Doctor.

Caught in a web of time travel and authoritarianism, the Doctor, Peri, and Herbert must unite to confront both the Borad's tyrannical rule and the Master’s deadly machinations, ultimately discovering the truth behind the Timelash and striving to free the oppressed people of Karfel.

## Continuity Notes:
1. **H.G. Wells Introduction:** "Timelash" features H.G. Wells, marking the last classic-era story centered around a historical figure. His presence enhances the narrative's complexity by addressing the Doctor's interactions with past companions like Jo Grant.
   
2. **Retcons and Past Adventures:** The narrative subtly acknowledges the Doctor's history, suggesting previously unseen adventures and emphasizing the show's rich continuity.
   
3. **Character Continuity:** The Doctor's familiarity with alien species and conflicts indicates a deeper connection to his past encounters, relying heavily on exposition.
   
4. **Link to "Arc of Infinity":** This installment aligns with a broader narrative that encapsulates a continuous journey through the Doctor's timeline, creating a sense of ongoing legacy.
   
5. **Sequential Development:** The heavy reliance on past events and implications showcases the show's willingness to expand its lore, even when the basis in visuals is lacking.

6. **Visual Elements and Tone:** Critiques of the production highlight a "tacky" style with erratic performances, setting "Timelash" apart from the series' more refined entries.

## Cultural Context and Historical Analysis:
"Timelash" engages with Victorian literature through its portrayal of H.G. Wells, exploring themes of technology's impact on society during the Industrial Revolution. The character of Herbert embodies the struggle against societal norms prevalent in Wells' works.

1. **Historical References:** By invoking Wells, the episode captures both the fascination and skepticism of the Victorian era regarding science—a vital underpinning for many sci-fi narratives.

2. **Cultural Impact:** The narrative is described as a parody of traditional science fiction, self-parodying tropes while being likened to "The Rocky Horror Show." Yet, it struggles to engage with its themes effectively.

3. **Themes of Identity and Legacy:** The meta-commentary on the show's history is noteworthy, offering layers of intertextuality for fans to appreciate.

4. **Sociopolitical Commentary:** The Borad's authoritarianism represents a critique of tyranny, with the Doctor's victory underscoring the importance of intellect over brute force.

## Production Notes:

- **Behind-the-Scenes Details:** This episode faced challenges linking Wells' narrative to the Doctor's and relied on significant exposition to justify character dynamics.

- **Special Effects:** While ambitious, the effects garnered criticism, particularly for the portrayal of the Timelash as overly "glittery" and unconvincing.

- **Production Challenges:** Glen McCoy's script has been labeled weak, with visual and set design also suffering as a result.

- **Cast Performance:** Paul Darrow's energetic portrayal of Tekker stood out amidst a generally lackluster cast, alongside critiques of Colin Baker’s performance.
