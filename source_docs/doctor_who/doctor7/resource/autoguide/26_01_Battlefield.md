## Plot Summary
"Battlefield" is the first serial of the 26th season of *Doctor Who*. It spans four episodes, introducing the Seventh Doctor and his companion Ace as they arrive in modern-day England amidst a clash between medieval knights from a parallel universe and contemporary military forces. The Doctor uncovers that King Arthur’s legendary sword, Excalibur, has been transported to Earth, and the powerful sorceress Morgaine is intent on reclaiming it.

The narrative unfolds with the Doctor reuniting with the retired Brigadier Lethbridge-Stewart, called back to aid in the battle. As Morgaine seeks to raise an army of the dead, she unleashes The Destroyer, a terrifying entity meant to assist her in her plans. The Doctor, alongside Ace and the Brigadier, must navigate this ancient conflict while contending with The Master, who has his own agenda.

Themes of mythology and honor are interwoven throughout the narrative, with the Doctor embracing the role of Merlin, the legendary wizard. The climax sees the Doctor's cleverness and bravery put to the test as he strives to thwart Morgaine's ambitions and restore balance to both the past and present. Ultimately, the story highlights the enduring bonds of friendship and loyalty amid the chaos of battle, marking a significant blend of science fiction and Arthurian legend within the *Doctor Who* universe.
