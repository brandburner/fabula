## Plot Summary  
"Silver Nemesis" celebrates the 25th anniversary of *Doctor Who*, featuring the Doctor and his companion Ace as they come across a meteor that crash-lands outside Windsor Castle. This meteor contains a statue called Nemesis, fashioned from living metal and created by the sorceress Lady Peinforte in 1638. Three factions vie for control over Nemesis as the narrative unfolds:  

1. **The Cybermen**, led by their Cyber Leader, attempt to harness its immense power.  
2. **Lady Peinforte** and her accomplice Richard aim to resurrect her historical dominance through the statue.  
3. A group of **neo-Nazis**, led by De Flores, intends to exploit Nemesis for their own sinister purposes.  

As the story progresses, the Doctor and Ace must navigate these conflicting desires to thwart the potential devastation that could arise from the statue falling into malevolent hands. The episode delves into themes of power, history's effects on the present, and the Doctor's protective role, culminating in a moral dilemma about responsible action versus inaction. The Cybermen's return provides a historic nod as this story marks their final appearance in the original series.
