### Plot Summary
In "The Greatest Show in the Galaxy," the Seventh Doctor and his companion Ace arrive on the desert planet of Segonax, intending to visit the infamous Psychic Circus. However, this circus is not what it seems; it is run by the sinister Chief Clown and his lethal robot clowns, who organize a talent contest for a bizarre family of gods.

As the Doctor and Ace become entangled in the deadly games of the circus, they meet Captain Cook and his companion Mags, a werewolf-like alien. The circus's dark secret is soon revealed: the family, known as the Gods of Ragnarok, thrives on entertainment and has a cruel penchant for destruction against those who fail to amuse them.

The Doctor must navigate the twisted dynamics of the circus, outsmart the gods, and save the performers caught in the deadly spectacle. This narrative explores themes of performance art, the nature of entertainment, and the perilous quest for approval from those wielding power. The mix of humor and horror culminates in a thrilling climax where the Doctor's cleverness shines, ensuring that everyone escapes the clutches of the gods.
