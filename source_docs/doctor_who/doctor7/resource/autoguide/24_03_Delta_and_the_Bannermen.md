## Plot Summary
On an alien planet, the merciless Bannermen, led by Gavrok, nearly complete the genocide of the Chimeron race. The last Chimeron, Queen Delta, escapes to reach a space tollport, clutching her egg. In 1959, a group of Navarinos—a shape-shifting race of tourists—hopes to visit Disneyland on Earth. They travel in a spaceship cleverly disguised as an old holiday bus. Delta stows away and meets Mel Bush, the Doctor's companion. As they land in a Welsh holiday camp, they quickly learn that the deadly Bannermen are in pursuit.

At the holiday camp, familiar faces, including the comedic Tollmaster Ken Dodd and the charming camp manager Weismuller, add a delightfully chaotic backdrop to the proceedings. A series of farcical and suspenseful adventures ensue as the Doctor must defend Delta, her egg, and the camp residents from Gavrok and his forces.

The narrative expertly juxtaposes the lighthearted holiday camp atmosphere with the dark undertones of genocide and menace, creating a uniquely blended story. The Doctor must devise a plan to thwart Gavrok while navigating the complexities of love and sacrifice among the Chimeron. As the story climaxes, emotional bonds are tested, and the resolution underscores themes of hope and resilience.
