## Plot Summary
"Ghost Light" is the second serial of the 26th season of *Doctor Who*, set in a mansion house in Perivale in 1883. The story begins in London in 1983 when an old house mysteriously burns down. The Seventh Doctor and his companion Ace arrive at Gabriel Chase, a sinister mansion in the rural hamlet of Perivale. The Doctor's purpose is to confront Ace's childhood fears and guilt linked to the house.

As they explore the mansion, they encounter Josiah Smith, a cataloguer of life forms from another planet, who has been manipulating the environment of the house. Smith, having "evolved" into a form approximating a human, seeks to assassinate Queen Victoria and take over the British Empire.

The plot delves into the history of an alien expedition that arrived on Earth thousands of years ago to catalogue life. The leader of the expedition, known as Light, is kept in hibernation below the house, while Smith controls Light and has imprisoned another crewmember, Control, in the cellar. The narrative interweaves elements of horror and surrealism as Ace confronts her past and the intertwined futures of herself and the house.

Throughout the three episodes, themes of evolution, fear, and the confrontation of one’s past are explored, culminating in a resolution that sees Ace facing her guilt and discovering her strength. The story is characterized by its complex narrative structure and rich character development, making it a memorable entry in the *Doctor Who* canon.
