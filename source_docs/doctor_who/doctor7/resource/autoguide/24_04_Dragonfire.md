## Plot Summary
In "Dragonfire," the Seventh Doctor and his companion Mel arrive at Iceworld, a trading colony located on the shadowed side of the planet Svartos. Here, they encounter Sabalom Glitz, who is entangled with the merciless crime lord Kane, long imprisoned in cryogenic stasis for three millennia. As Kane aspires to reclaim the power source of his ship to return home, the Doctor and Mel join Glitz on an adventurous quest to reveal the enigma of Iceworld and retrieve a treasure believed to be safeguarded by a mythical dragon. Amidst the chaos, Mel prepares to receive her farewell, allowing Ace to step in as the Doctor's new companion. The narrative unfolds themes of loyalty, redemption, and the tenuous grasp separating good from evil, leading to a climactic confrontation with Kane and the mysteries surrounding Iceworld.
