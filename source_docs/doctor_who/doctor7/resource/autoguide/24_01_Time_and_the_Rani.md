During the initial confusion of his recent transformation, the Doctor becomes separated from his companion Mel. In a twist of fate, he is tricked into aiding the Rani with her sinister plot to create a massive time manipulation device using the brilliant minds she has kidnapped.

Meanwhile, Mel finds herself alone on the desolate surface of Lakertya. Despite the Rani's traps and her repulsive bat-like minions known as the Tetraps, she joins forces with a group of rebellious Lakertyans who have risen up against the Rani’s iron grip. Together, they work against time to rescue the kidnapped geniuses and thwart the Rani's ambitions to execute her nefarious plan.

As the story progresses, the Doctor endeavors to reclaim his lost memories and harness his newfound capabilities to confront the Rani, ultimately striving to prevent a fate that would disrupt the very fabric of time.
