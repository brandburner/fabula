## Plot Summary
The Seventh Doctor and his companion, Ace, arrive on Terra Alpha, a dystopian planet governed by the tyrannical Helen A. On Terra Alpha, happiness is mandated, and sadness is prohibited. The duo is quickly drawn into the oppressive society's conflict, witnessing the brutal enforcement of a joyless existence by the Happiness Patrol, a police force that punishes any form of dissent or negative emotion.

As the Doctor seeks to understand the significance of the enforced happiness, he helps ignite a rebellion among the repressed citizens, including characters like the rebel leader Joseph C and the enigmatic Daisy K. Throughout their adventure, they confront Helen A, her executioners, and the grotesque Kandy Man, who symbolizes the absurdity and danger of forced cheerfulness. The Doctor ultimately orchestrates a battle for freedom that blurs the lines between satire and social commentary, compelling the society to confront its own form of madness.

7. **Visual Styling and Tone:** The visual stylistics of this serial can be compared to "The Trial of a Time Lord," featuring a vibrant yet surreal aesthetic that conveys both macabre and whimsical qualities reflective of the narrative.

8. **Structural Continuity:** The formula of rebellion against an oppressive regime is a staple in Doctor Who, timelessly echoed in arcs such as "The Time Warrior," making it relatable and engaging for the audience.
