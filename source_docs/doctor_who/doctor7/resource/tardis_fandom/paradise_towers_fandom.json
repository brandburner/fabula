      "notes": [
        "This story may have had a working title of Paradise Tower, but this may simply be a misprint on the commissioning documents for the story.",
        "Ronald Lacey, T. P. McKenna, Denis Quilley and Ian Richardson were considered for the role of the Chief Caretaker.",
        "Phillip Jackson and Roger Daltry were considered for the Deputy Chief Caretaker.",
        "Frances Cuka was considered for Maddy.",
        "Edward Hardwicke was cast as the Deputy but dropped out and was replaced by Clive Merrison.",
        "The music score for this story was originally made by freelance composer David Snell. John Nathan-Turner rejected the music after it was completed, deeming it too repetitive. Keff McCulloch provided the replacement score inside of a week despite working on Time and the Rani and Delta and the Bannermen at the same time.",
        "The Blue Kang Leader was unnamed on-screen but was given the name Drinking Fountain in Stephen Wyatt's novelisation. This was not derived from any information given in the televised version.",
        "In successive drafts of the script, the planet on which Paradise Towers was located was referred to as \"Kroagnon\", and then as \"Griphos\". The world was eventually left unnamed on-screen, but there does exist a possibility that it could be Earth.",
        "While the Doctor does carry an umbrella as part of his attire in this story, the first appearance of his trademark Question Mark umbrella is the next serial, Delta and the Bannermen.",
        "The script was written before Sylvester McCoy was cast. Stephen Wyatt was given McCoy's audition tape as a guide to his Doctor's characterization. He'd seen McCoy onstage and agreed with John Nathan-Turner that he should echo Patrick Troughton.",
        "Richard Briers' performance has attracted considerable criticism. In the DVD special features, it is mentioned that both John Nathan-Turner and Andrew Cartmel were unhappy with his performance during the recording, and Briers admits he ignored directions to tone it down.",
        "Pex was meant to be a huge musclebound man, but it didn't quite pan out that way, as Andrew Cartmel recalls.",
        "Some of the barrels used as set dressing in the Kangs' lair still have the faded or painted-over remains of the Weyland-Yutani logo visible on them \u2014 they're one of many old Alien and Aliens props used throughout the Eighties.",
        "Following the Hungerford Massacre, complaints from the public regarding violence in entertainment prompted Michael Grade to ask for the serial to be re-edited for overseas sale. In particular, several trims were made to sequences in Tilda and Tabby's flat which made conspicuous use of knives."

They encounter the Kangs, teenage girl gangs who have divided the complex between them. The Kangs are being terrorized by the Cleaners, robot servants that have turned murderous. The Doctor discovers that the complex was designed by an architect named Kroagnon, who has taken over the body of the Chief Caretaker. Kroagnon plans to destroy the inhabitants of Paradise Towers. The Doctor works with the Kangs, Rezzies (middle-aged residents), and Caretakers to defeat Kroagnon and the Cleaners. In the end, Pex sacrifices himself to stop Kroagnon, and the Doctor and Mel depart, leaving the residents to rebuild their community."
