The circus itself is dominated by the sinister chief clown and his deadly troupe of robot clowns, who organise a talent contest in which all visitors take part. The audience consists of just a strange family \u2014 mother, father and daughter \u2014 who are in reality the Gods of Ragnarok, powerful creatures with an insatiable craving for entertainment who invariably destroy those who fail to please them. With Ace's help, the Doctor ends the gods' influence on Segonax and returns the circus to the control of its original owners."

The chief clown is hunting down the performers who have escaped the circus. In part two, the Doctor enters the talent contest along with the other captives, while Ace evades the chief clown and meets Bellboy. In part three, Ace defeats the malfunctioning robot clowns and learns more about the circus's history, while the Doctor confronts the family who are revealed to be the Gods of Ragnarok. In part four, the Doctor battles the Gods of Ragnarok, who feed on entertainment, and with Ace's help is able to destroy their influence over the circus, allowing it to return to its original owners."
