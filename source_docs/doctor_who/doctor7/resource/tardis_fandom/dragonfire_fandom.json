Glitz is searching for a treasure guarded by a 'dragon' in the icy caverns below Iceworld. They also meet a new companion, a young woman named Ace, who has recently arrived on Iceworld via a time storm. \n\nIceworld is controlled by the callous Kane, who has a cryogenic chamber where he freezes his employees and supporters. Glitz is in debt to Kane, who is using him to search for the treasure. The 'dragon' is revealed to be an advanced biped creature with laser-firing eyes, guarding a valuable crystal inside its head - the 'Dragonfire' that Kane needs to escape his exile on Iceworld.\n\nAfter a series of confrontations, the Doctor is able to retrieve the crystal and stop Kane from using it to activate Iceworld as a spacecraft and escape. Kane is ultimately destroyed when exposed to sunlight. Glitz claims Iceworld as his own ship, and Mel decides to stay with him, leaving the Doctor to take Ace back to her home in Perivale."
