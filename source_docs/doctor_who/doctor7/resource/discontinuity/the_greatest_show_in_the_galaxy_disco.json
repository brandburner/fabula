    "bottom_line": "A return of chaos, magic and surrealism to Doctor Who, the story summed up by the scene in which the Doctor walks out of a confrontation amid carnage. Whizz Kid is a (not very subtle) parody of anally retentive, obsessive fans. The ideas in this, one of the most iconic stories, are very imaginative and the direction is psychedelic."
