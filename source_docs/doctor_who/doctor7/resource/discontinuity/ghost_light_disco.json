However, in order to appreciate fully what's going on it is probably necessary to watch 'Ghost Light' two or three times. 'Ghost Light' is a superb example of Andrew Cartmel's vision for Doctor Who. The design is flawless, the direction is beautiful, and the script is a heady mix of the humorous and the macabre (especially when Inspector Mackenzie, the 'cream of Scotland Yard', is turned into primordial soup)."
