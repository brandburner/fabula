The Doctor is as violent as he's ever been, engaging in fisticuffs, carrying a gun and describing Sarah as 'Miss Smith, my best friend' (turning Sarah from a flapping ornament into a quasi-Mrs Peel). Another gem, and one much befitting from an excellent performance from Tony Beckley as Harrison Chase (the scene in episode five in which Chase communicates with his plants is particularly chilling)."
