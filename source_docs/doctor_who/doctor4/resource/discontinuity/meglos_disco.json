It gets off to a great start, but rather loses its way, becoming a bit dull and not bothering to tell the viewers who or what Meglos is. It remains reasonably exciting, though, and there are some big ideas at work. You only realise that this is going to self-destruct towards the end, largely due to Terence Dudley's thoughtful direction."
