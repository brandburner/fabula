In the jungle, they find a large empty egg and are soon caught by Adrasta and her guards. Romana is taken by bandits, while the Doctor is presented to Adrasta and learns about a creature trapped within the Pit. Events lead the Doctor to explore the Pit, where he encounters the creature and a fellow prisoner, Organon. They learn the creature is Erato, an ambassador from Tythonus seeking a trade agreement. Adrasta sought to maintain power by imprisoning Erato, leading to deadly consequences. Ultimately, the Doctor and Erato work together to stop a neutron star sent to destroy Chloris."
