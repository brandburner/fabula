The Master, having recently gained control over the body of Tremas, seeks to wreak havoc across the universe, using Logopolis for his own purposes. Meanwhile, a mysterious figure known as the Watcher observes these events. Several companions, including new additions Nyssa and Tegan, become entangled in this conflict. Entropy threatens to unravel the universe and the Doctor must unite with the Master to save reality. However, their alliance leads to the Doctor falling from the Pharos Project's radio telescope, ushering in his regeneration into his fifth incarnation."
