Mysterious events ensue as a light falls from the sky, a green glow emerges from the ocean, and all manner of power fluctuations occur. After one of the lighthouse keepers is found dead, the Doctor investigates. He discovers that a Rutan scout, an alien and enemy of the Sontarans, has taken the form of the deceased Reuben and is sabotaging the lighthouse to fend off humans while summoning reinforcements. After a series of deaths, the Doctor and Leela manage to defeat the creature by weaponizing the lighthouse's lamp into a laser, destroying the approaching Rutan ship."
