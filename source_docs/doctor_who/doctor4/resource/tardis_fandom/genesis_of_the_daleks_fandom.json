On Skaro, the Doctor and his companions, Sarah and Harry, find themselves in the midst of a Thousand Year War between the Kaleds and Thals. Davros, the Kaled scientist, has been experimenting and creating a new race, the Daleks, to ensure Kaled supremacy. The Doctor faces a moral dilemma about potentially committing genocide to stop the Daleks and ultimately decides to delay their development instead of destroying them. The story concludes with the Daleks entombed, but not destroyed, leaving their rise inevitable. The Doctor, Harry, and Sarah escape Skaro using a Time Ring."
