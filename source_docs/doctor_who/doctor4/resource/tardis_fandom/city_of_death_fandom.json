They discover Count Scarlioni, who is using time travel technology for schemes involving multiple copies of the Mona Lisa. The Count, actually an alien splintered across time, seeks to save his people by manipulating history. However, he is thwarted by the Doctor's intervention, particularly due to Duggan's decisive actions. The events conclude with the Doctor asserting that history should remain unchanged, thereby ensuring the continuity of life on Earth."
