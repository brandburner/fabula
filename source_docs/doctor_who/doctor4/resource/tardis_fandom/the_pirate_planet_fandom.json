The mentally affected native Pralix is taken by the telepathic Mentiads. As the Doctor navigates the Captain's operations, he learns of Queen Xanxia's manipulation from stasis. The Doctor, with Romana, disables the Captain's control, aids the Mentiads, and uses Calufrax's core\u2014a segment of the Key to Time\u2014to finally stop the planet-encasing operations and end Xanxia's reign."
