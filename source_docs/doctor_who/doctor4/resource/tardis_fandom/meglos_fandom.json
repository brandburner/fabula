Meanwhile, Meglos, a cactus-like Zolfa-Thuran, plots to steal the Dodecahedron for its immense power. He devises a plan to impersonate the Doctor by transferring his consciousness into a human body. As the real Doctor and Romana become trapped in a time loop, Meglos makes his way to Tigella and sows chaos by impersonating the Doctor. Ultimately, the true Doctor disrupts Meglos's plan and saves the planet, allowing the Tigellans to thrive once again."
