The Fourth Doctor and Sarah Jane land at the Scarman family home in England. They uncover Egyptian artifacts and battle robotic mummies that serve Sutekh. Over the course of four parts, they confront Sutekh's servant, Marcus's reanimated corpse, and race against time to prevent the destruction of Earth and Mars. The Doctor ultimately uses his wit and tools, including a fake mummy disguise and the TARDIS's time travel capabilities, to trap Sutekh in time permanently."
