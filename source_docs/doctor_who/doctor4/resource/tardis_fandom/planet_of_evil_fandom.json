The Doctor discovers the planet is a boundary to the anti-matter universe. Sorenson's mineral research for an energy source causes him to mutate into a creature, jeopardizing the mission. Through various tensions and pursuits, the Doctor ultimately resolves the situation by returning the anti-matter and Sorenson is restored to normal. They depart, keeping a promise to the energy being on the planet."
