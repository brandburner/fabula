They're at stalemate in an interplanetary war with the Movellans. Davros is revived and aims to give the Daleks a strategic edge. The Movellans want the Doctor to do the same for them. Using clever tactics, the Doctor incapacitates both enemies, freezing Davros to be later tried for his crimes, while Romana and the Doctor escape."
