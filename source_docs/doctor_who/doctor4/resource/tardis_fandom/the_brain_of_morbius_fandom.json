The Sisterhood of Karn, a group with psychic powers tied to the Elixir of Life, are protective of their own resources and mistrustful of outsiders. After various incidents involving the Doctor getting captured and escaping, Solon succeeds in bringing Morbius back to life as a monstrous creature. The Doctor ultimately defeats Morbius through a mindbending contest, leading to Morbius's savage form being driven off a cliff. The Doctor is restored to life through a fresh elixir from the Sisterhood and departs with Sarah in the TARDIS."
