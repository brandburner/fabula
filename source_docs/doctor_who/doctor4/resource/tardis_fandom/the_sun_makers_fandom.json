The Doctor, Leela, and K9 discover Megropolis One is under oppressive rule by the Collector. Cordo, a worker, faces taxation he can't afford, leading him to contemplate suicide, but he is saved by the Doctor and Leela. They join the rebel band against the oppressive regime, leveraging technology and K9 to challenge the ruling elite, ultimately causing the Collector's plan to backfire, restoring the dignity and freedom of Megropolis' inhabitants."
