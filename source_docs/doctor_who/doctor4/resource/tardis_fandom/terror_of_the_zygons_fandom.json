They unravel a mystery involving the Zygons who control the legendary Loch Ness Monster. Realising the Zygons' intention to conquer Earth, the Doctor and his companions devise a plan to defeat them. The Zygons have a ship and the power to change shape, making it difficult to identify who is friend or foe. After several confrontations and the discovery of Zygon technology, the Doctor destroys the Zygon ship and deactivates their control over the Skarasen, who returns to Loch Ness."
