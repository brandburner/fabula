They stand accused of a series of murders at the hands of the miner's crew, who suspect the robots that serve them. As the Doctor attempts to prove their innocence and uncover the true murderer, it becomes clear a conspiracy involving a human posing as the mysterious figure, Taren Capel, desires to incite a robot rebellion. A showdown of evasive maneuvers and clever strategy ultimately reveals that one of the crew members is the mastermind behind the murders, leading to a resolution where the Doctor and Leela leave the surviving crew awaiting rescue."
