The Fourth Doctor and Romana discover a drug smuggling operation involving vraxoin, an addictive substance produced by the Mandrels. Using the Continuous Event Transmuter, which can displace entire areas from planets, scientist Tryst and pilot Dymond plan to smuggle the drug. The Doctor realizes that killing Mandrels produces vraxoin. After separating the ships and defeating Tryst and Dymond, who are arrested, the Doctor returns the Mandrels to Eden."
