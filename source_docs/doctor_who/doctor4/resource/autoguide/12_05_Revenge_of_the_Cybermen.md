The story sees the Fourth Doctor and his companions Sarah Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan arriving at Space Station Nerva, where a deadly plague threatens the crew. The Cybermen, having returned as the main antagonists for the first time since *The Invasion* in 1968, are plotting to destroy Voga, the planet of gold. The Doctor and his companions must navigate the treacherous situation while contending with both the Cybermen's nefarious plans and a conspiracy involving the station's crew, ultimately leading to a confrontation that will determine the fate of both the station and Voga.

Overall, "Revenge of the Cybermen" is a significant addition to the *Doctor Who* canon, showcasing the series' blend of science fiction, adventure, and moral dilemmas.

## Continuity Notes
1. **Return of the Cybermen**: This serial marks the first appearance of the Cybermen as lead villains since *The Invasion* (1968). It is also notable that this is their only appearance until *Earthshock* (1982), making it significant in the continuity of the Cybermen's role in the series.
