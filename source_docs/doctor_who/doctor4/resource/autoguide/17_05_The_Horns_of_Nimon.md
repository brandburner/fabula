## Plot Summary:
When the TARDIS collides with a spaceship en route to the planet Skonnos, the Fourth Doctor, Romana II, and K-9 soon uncover the horrific truth about its cargo: the ship is carrying young sacrifices for a powerful, horned creature known as the Nimon. The Skonnon Empire, in decline, has turned to the practice of sending tributes to this creature in hopes of gaining power and technology to create a second galactic empire. 

As the Doctor and Romana navigate through the labyrinthine Power Complex on Skonnos, they encounter various challenges and ultimately face the Nimon itself. The story unfolds over four parts, with the Doctor and his companions uncovering the dark secrets behind the Nimon's demands and the Skonnons' desperation.

Key themes of the episode include sacrifice, power, and the exploitation of weaker societies. The characters must confront moral dilemmas as they seek to stop the Nimon and save those who are being sacrificed. The episode is noted for its unique blend of science fiction and mythological elements, drawing parallels to the myth of the Minotaur and the labyrinth.

This episode marked a significant point in the Doctor Who series as it was the final story to be broadcast in the 1970s and the first to air in the 1980s.

## Continuity Notes:
1. **Nimon Appearances**: The Nimon reappear in several other media, including the audio drama "Seasons of Fear," the comic "Space in Dimension Relative and Time," and the prose story "The Maze of Doom." They are depicted as a monstrous race reminiscent of the Minotaur.
 
2. **Mythological Connections**: The story draws heavily on Greek mythology, specifically the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. The names in the story serve as anagrams or near-anagrams of mythological names:
   - **Athens** → **Aneth**
   - **Knossos** → **Skonnos**
   - **Theseus** → **Seth**
   - **Minos** → **Nimon**
   - **Corinth** → **Crinoth**
   
   The setting of the Power Complex serves as an analogy to the Labyrinth, and the Nimon function as a stand-in for the Minotaur.

3. **Third Doctor Reference**: The Third Doctor once acted like a toreador to distract a Minotaur in "The Time Monster," connecting the themes of bull-like creatures in both stories.

4. **Character Continuity**: This story marks David Brierley's final vocal performance as K-9, who is replaced by John Leeson in subsequent episodes starting from "The Leisure Hive."

5. **World-Building**: The planet Skonnos was once home to a vast empire that included over a hundred star systems, having fallen into civil war. The Nimon have invaded and devastated one of its planets, Crinoth.

6. **Technology References**: Romana constructs her own sonic screwdriver, showcasing her ingenuity. The Nimon utilize a travel capsule similar to a Transmat, highlighting the technological elements in the story.

7. **TARDIS Features**: The TARDIS is shown to have advanced defense shields that can extend outside the ship, maintaining an atmosphere around it. This episode also features the removal of the time rotor, a first in the series.

8. **Cultural References**: The Doctor quotes Hamlet, saying, "Oh my prophetic soul," showcasing the blending of cultural references within the narrative.

9. **Production Notes**: The story had a working title of "Horns of Nimon" and was intended to be the final story of the Graham Williams era, although it was not planned that way initially.

## Cultural Context Notes:
1. **Mythological References**: The Nimon represents a reinterpretation of the Minotaur myth, where young people are sacrificed to appease this horned being. The storyline involves themes of power struggles and the manipulation of belief systems, as the Nimon is revered as a god by the Skonnan leader, Soldeed. This reflects broader themes in mythology where deities demand sacrifices from their followers.

2. **Historical Parallels**: The serial coincided with the British pantomime season, which influenced its tone and script. The inclusion of humor and the absurdity of the Nimon costumes connect it to the theatrical traditions of the time, showcasing how television blended with live performance.

3. **Cultural Impact**: The serial has been met with mixed reviews over the years. While some critics have labeled it as low in quality due to its production values, others have noted its clever use of mythology. Critics from "Doctor Who: The Television Companion" acknowledged its light-heartedness and the serious performance from Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor.

4. **Influence on Popular Culture**: "The Horns of Nimon" has also been referenced in discussions about adaptations and reinterpretations of mythological themes in modern storytelling. Andrew Blair from Den of Geek highlighted how this story could inspire a musical adaptation due to its narrative structure and character dynamics.

5. **Critical Reception**: The reviews have varied, with some praising its ingenuity while others criticized its execution. It has been described as a "turgid quagmire" by Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times, while others have pointed to its interesting concepts that were poorly realized.

## Reception Notes:

  - A review on **IMDb** highlights that while the production values are lacking, the humor and campiness resonate with a segment of the audience.
