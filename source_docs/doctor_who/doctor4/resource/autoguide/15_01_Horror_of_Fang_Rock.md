The TARDIS lands on the island of Fang Rock, situated off the south coast of England in the early 20th century.

Upon arrival at the lighthouse, they introduce themselves but quickly discover the dead body of one of the keepers named Ben. The remaining keepers, Reuben and Vince Hawkins, inform them that a mysterious light fell from the sky near the island. The electricity flow to the lighthouse lamp has become erratic, leading the Doctor to deduce that a force is feeding on the power supply.

As the Doctor and Leela delve deeper into the mystery, they encounter supernatural occurrences, including the unsettling movement of Ben’s body. The narrative intensifies as a shapeshifting alien scout, known as a Rutan, infiltrates the lighthouse with intentions to use the planet as a strategic base in the ongoing war against the Sontarans.
