## Plot Summary
The TARDIS arrives near an unstable area on the interstellar cruise ship *Empress*, which has emerged from hyperspace at the same coordinates as the trade ship *Hecate*, locking the two crafts together. The Doctor offers his services to detach the two ships. Captain Rigg, wary of the Doctor, reluctantly allows him to try. Aboard the *Empress* are zoologist Professor Tryst and his assistant Della, who are utilizing their CET (Continual Event Transmuter) Machine to store portions of planets on electromagnetic crystals for a holographic zoo.

As the narrative unfolds, it becomes evident that drug smugglers are using the alien creatures known as Mandrels to traffic Vraxoin, a highly addictive drug. When these creatures escape, chaos ensues aboard the ship. With the Doctor caught in the midst of the ensuing turmoil, he must uncover the smuggling plot while ensuring the safety of everyone on board.
