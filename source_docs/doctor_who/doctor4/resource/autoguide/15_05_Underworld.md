## Plot Summary
In the history of the Time Lords, their engagement with the Minyans of Minyos is deemed disastrous. Initially, the Minyans revered the Time Lords as gods, but their exposure to advanced science led to their expulsion of the Time Lords. This sparked resentment and a consequential civil war fueled by the advanced weaponry provided by the Time Lords, culminating in the annihilation of their home planet.

On the edge of the universe, the Doctor, Leela, and K9 encounter a Minyan ship on a desperate quest to recover their genetic race banks. They must confront the repercussions of the Time Lords' past actions and navigate the remnants of a forgotten civilization.
