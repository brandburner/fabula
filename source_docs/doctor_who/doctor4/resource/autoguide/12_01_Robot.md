## Plot Summary

"Robot" is the first serial of the 12th season of the British science fiction television series *Doctor Who*. This four-episode story arc marks the debut of Tom Baker as the Fourth Doctor, who is recovering from his regeneration when he is drawn into a mystery involving an experimental robot, K1, created by Professor Kettlewell.

The narrative unfolds as the Doctor, alongside his companions Sarah Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan, investigates a series of strange occurrences linked to the robot. K1 has fallen into the hands of a malevolent director at a secret research institute, who intends to use the robot to steal nuclear launch codes and blackmail global governments.

As the Doctor and his team confront the director and his henchmen, they encounter various challenges, including K1, who at first seems to be a mindless weapon but ultimately reveals a deeper, more complex personality.
