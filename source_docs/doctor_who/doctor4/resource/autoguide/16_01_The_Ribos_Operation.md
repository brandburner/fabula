## Plot Summary
"The Ribos Operation" is the inaugural serial of *Doctor Who's* 16th season, launching the season-long narrative arc that revolves around the quest for the Key to Time. The story begins when the White Guardian, played by Cyril Luckham, recruits the Fourth Doctor (Tom Baker) to locate six hidden segments of the Key. He is joined by Romana, a Time Lady played by Mary Tamm, who is both intelligent and resourceful.

Their journey takes them to the primitive planet Ribos, where they must find the first segment, cleverly disguised as a rare element known as jethrik. Here, they confront Graff Vynda-K, the exiled Emperor of Levithia, who seeks the jethrik for his own nefarious purposes. The plot unfolds through a mix of political intrigue, deception, and the looming threat posed by the Black Guardian, who is intent on acquiring the segments for evil ends.

Over the course of four episodes, the Doctor and Romana navigate the local culture, interact with its inhabitants, and engage in a battle of wits against mercenaries in a race to secure the jethrik. The serial not only introduces key characters and elements into the *Doctor Who* universe but also sets the stage for the adventures to come in the Key to Time storyline.
