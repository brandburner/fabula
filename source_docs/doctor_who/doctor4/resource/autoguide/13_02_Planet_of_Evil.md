## Plot Summary
*Planet of Evil* is the second serial of the 13th season of *Doctor Who*. The narrative unfolds on the planet Zeta Minor, the last undiscovered planet in the known universe, set more than 30,000 years in the future.

The story begins with the TARDIS responding to a distress call from Zeta Minor. The Fourth Doctor and his companion Sarah Jane Smith arrive at a geological expedition led by Professor Sorenson, who aims to exploit the antimatter minerals of the planet for energy. However, the expedition is under threat from a creature from an antimatter universe, leading to a series of mysterious deaths among the crew.

As the Doctor investigates, he discovers that Sorenson's ambitions to harness antimatter have dire consequences. The plot delves into themes of fear, ambition, and the darker aspects of human nature, drawing parallels to Robert Louis Stevensonâ€™s *Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde*.

Throughout the serial, the Doctor grapples with both the external threat posed by the creature and the internal conflicts of the characters, who confront their fears and moral dilemmas. Ultimately, the Doctor persuades Sorenson to sacrifice himself to halt the creature and save the remaining crew members. The story concludes with the Doctor and Sarah reflecting on the nature of good and evil as they depart Zeta Minor.

The serial has been praised for its production design, particularly the jungle set, and for the performances of the cast, especially Frederick Jaeger as Sorenson.
