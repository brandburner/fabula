The TARDIS materializes on an aged space station known as Nerva, which appears to be deserted. As the Fourth Doctor, Sarah Jane, and Harry Sullivan explore the station, Sarah is overcome by a lack of oxygen and is transported into cryonic suspension by the station's computer. The Doctor and Harry discover that the station is essentially an ark designed to preserve humanity. They encounter Vira, who is revived from suspended animation, and together they uncover the mysteries of the station.

They learn that the station is under threat from the Wirrn, insectoid aliens who intend to absorb the humans and their knowledge. As they struggle against the Wirrn, the Doctor and his companions must defend the last survivors of humanity, including their leader Noah, against this alien menace.
