## Plot Summary
"The Sun Makers" is the fourth serial of the 15th season of the British science fiction television series *Doctor Who*. The story is set on Pluto in a distant future where humans are oppressed by a monopolistic corporation that controls their lives through excessive taxation.

The Fourth Doctor, along with his companion Leela and K9, arrives on Pluto just in time to stop a citizen named Cordo from ending his life due to overwhelming tax debts. The inhabitants of Pluto are forced to pay exorbitant taxes to the "Company," which has a tight grip on their lives, leading many to live in the dark, oppressive tunnels of the Undercity.

The Doctor, Leela, and Cordo venture into the Undercity, where they encounter a group of outcasts and thieves led by the ruthless Mandrel. The Doctor learns about the Company's exploitation and the Collector, who oversees the operations on Pluto. As they navigate through the dangers of the Undercity, the Doctor and Leela devise a plan to incite a revolution among the oppressed citizens against their alien rulers.

Throughout the serial, themes of rebellion against tyranny and the absurdity of bureaucracy are explored, with humor interspersed amidst the serious undertones of economic exploitation. The Doctor ultimately rallies the Plutonians to rise up against the oppressive system, leading to a confrontation with the Collector and a dramatic change in their society.
