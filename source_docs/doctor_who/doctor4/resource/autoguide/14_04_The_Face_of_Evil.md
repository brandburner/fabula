## Plot Summary
"The Face of Evil" is set on a jungle planet called Thoros-Beta, where two tribes, the savage Sevateem and the technologically advanced Tesh, are embroiled in conflict. The Fourth Doctor arrives on the planet and quickly becomes entangled in their struggles. He meets Leela, a fierce warrior of the Sevateem, who believes the Doctor is the embodiment of an evil god known as Xoanon.

The backstory reveals that Thoros-Beta is the result of a human expedition gone awry, leading to Xoanon, an advanced computer, manipulating the tribes' existence through a split personality. The Doctor learns that the Sevateem perceive him as the Evil One, complicating his efforts to mediate peace. As he interacts with Leela and the tribes, he discovers Xoanon's role in creating two distinct human races through eugenics, resulting in the primal Sevateem and the psychic Tesh.

The Doctor's goal is to repair Xoanon’s malfunctioning personality, which has incited enmity and confusion among the tribes.
