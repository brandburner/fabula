## Plot Summary
Millennia ago on the planet Kastria, a traitor named Eldrad is sentenced to death for his crimes, including the destruction of the barriers that kept the solar winds at bay. Although Eldrad's body is obliterated, his hand survives. In present-day England, the Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith arrive in the TARDIS at a quarry during a blasting operation. When a blast uncovers the stone hand, Sarah touches it and becomes possessed by Eldrad's spirit.

The Doctor and Sarah, unaware of the hand's significance, are drawn into a conflict involving a nuclear power station and the quest of Eldrad to regain a physical form. As Eldrad takes control of Sarah, the Doctor must find a way to thwart the alien's plans, which involve using the power station's radiation to regenerate their body. The plot thickens as the Doctor and Sarah encounter various personnel at the nuclear facility, leading to a confrontation that reveals the true nature of Eldrad's past and the consequences of their actions.

Ultimately, the Doctor must confront the moral implications of Eldrad's vengeance against their people, and with the help of his companions, seeks a resolution that balances justice and mercy. The serial serves as a poignant farewell to Elisabeth Sladen as Sarah Jane Smith, marking a significant moment in the history of Doctor Who.
