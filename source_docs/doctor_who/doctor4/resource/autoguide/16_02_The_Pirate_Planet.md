## Plot Summary
In *The Pirate Planet*, the Fourth Doctor and his companion Romana embark on a quest to find the second segment of the Key to Time, leading them to the seemingly dull planet of Calufrax. However, upon their arrival, they discover they have actually landed on Zanak—a hollowed-out planet that serves as a spaceship. Governed by the tyrannical Captain and Queen Xanxia, Zanak is engaged in the systematic plundering of smaller planets for their resources.

The inhabitants of Zanak live in a false facade of prosperity, while the Mentiads, a group with mysterious telepathic abilities, are marginalized and feared. As the Doctor navigates this perilous world, he uncovers the Captain's true intentions and the dark secrets of the Mentiads. The story culminates in a fierce confrontation that reveals the depth of exploitation on Zanak and the lengths to which its rulers will go to maintain power.
