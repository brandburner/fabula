## Plot Summary
"Shada" is a compelling narrative woven into the fabric of Doctor Who, in which the Fourth Doctor receives a distress signal from Professor Chronotis, a Time Lord who masquerades as a professor at St Cedd's College, Cambridge. Professor Chronotis had previously loaned a crucial Gallifreyan tome to his student, Chris Parsons. 

As the Doctor arrives to retrieve the book, tragedy strikes—Chronotis is killed when Skagra, a mad scientist, extracts his mind using a mysterious sphere. Skagra's aim is to unlock the secrets of the planet Shada, a prison world where a dangerous Time Lord named Salyavin is held captive. 

The Doctor, alongside his companions Romana and K9, as well as Chris, find themselves ensnared in Skagra's nefarious plot. Skagra intends to absorb Salyavin’s mind, creating a Universal Mind capable of controlling all life. The Doctor must navigate the complexities of time travel and mind control, racing against the clock to thwart Skagra’s malevolent designs.

The storyline is marked by twists and turns involving time, intellect, and a climactic confrontation on the planet Shada. The narrative’s completion in 2017, featuring newly recorded dialogue and animations, has solidified its status as a significant part of Doctor Who's legacy.
