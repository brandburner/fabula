### Plot Summary
In "The Invasion of Time," the Fourth Doctor returns to Gallifrey with his companion Leela and K9, claiming the presidency of the Time Lords, a position he is entitled to by Time Lord law. His first act is to order the presidential suite to be lined with lead, which baffles Leela and K9. During his induction ceremony, the Crown of Rassilon seemingly rejects the Doctor, injuring him.

As the story unfolds, it is revealed that the Vardans have infiltrated Gallifrey and are collaborating with the Sontarans, who plan to seize control of the Time Lords' power. The Doctor's calculated actions lead to a confrontation with the invaders, as he tries to protect Gallifrey and counter the threat posed by the Sontarans, led by Commander Stor. In a twist, the Doctor sabotages Gallifrey's defenses to allow the Sontarans entry, resulting in a tense standoff.
