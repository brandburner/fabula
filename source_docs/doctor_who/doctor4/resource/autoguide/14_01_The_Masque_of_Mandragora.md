## Plot Summary
*The Masque of Mandragora* is set in the fictional European duchy of San Martino during the late 15th century. The story begins with the Doctor and Sarah Jane Smith encountering a swirl of living energy in the time vortex, known as the Mandragora Helix, which draws the TARDIS into its power. They arrive in Renaissance Italy, where they become embroiled in a plot involving Count Federico and the astrologer Hieronymous, who seeks to summon the Mandragora Helix to gain control over the Earth.

As the Doctor and Sarah navigate the treachery of the local nobility, they uncover Hieronymous's plans to use the Helix's power to dominate their world, manipulating events through fear and dark magic. The Doctor must devise a way to stop the sinister plot and prevent the forces of the Mandragora from wreaking havoc in the realm, while also helping local heroes, including Giuliano, to oppose Hieronymous's tyranny.

The Doctor's quick wit and intelligence are put to the test as he battles against time and dark forces, culminating in a dramatic confrontation at a grand masquerade ball, where the fate of San Martino hangs in the balance. Ultimately, the Doctor manages to put an end to Hieronymous's schemes and restore peace to the duchy before the TARDIS continues on its adventures.
