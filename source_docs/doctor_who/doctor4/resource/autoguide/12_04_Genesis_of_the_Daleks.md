## Plot Summary
In *Genesis of the Daleks*, the Fourth Doctor and his companions, Sarah Jane Smith and Harry Sullivan, are intercepted by the Time Lords. They are instructed to travel back to the planet Skaro to prevent the creation of the Daleks, a task that poses significant moral dilemmas regarding time travel and genocide. The Doctor and his companions arrive on a war-torn Skaro, where they encounter the Kaleds and the Thals, two factions embroiled in a brutal conflict.

As they navigate the dangers of this volatile environment, the Doctor and Harry are captured by the Kaleds and brought to their military headquarters, where they meet the lead scientist, Davros. Davros is revealed to be conducting unethical experiments to create a new race of beings, which will eventually become the Daleks. Despite the Doctor's attempts to halt Davros' plans, the situation spirals out of control as Davros manipulates events to ensure the Daleks' creation.
