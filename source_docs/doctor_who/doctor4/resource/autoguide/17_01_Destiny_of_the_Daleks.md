## Plot Summary
The Fourth Doctor and a newly regenerated Romana arrive on the desolate planet Skaro, centuries after the events of "Genesis of the Daleks." Here, they find the Daleks trapped in a protracted stalemate with the Movellans, an advanced alien race. Desperate for an edge in their war, the Daleks awaken their creator, Davros, who is found in suspended animation.

Romana's regeneration leads her to adopt the form of Princess Astra, a choice that the Doctor initially disapproves of. Meanwhile, K9, their robotic companion, suffers from laryngitis, complicating their communication. When a rockfall separates the Doctor and Romana, she is captured by the Daleks and forced into labor, while the Doctor seeks to ally with the Movellans, who are equally determined to end the conflict.

As tensions rise between the Daleks and Movellans, the Doctor and Romana must navigate a web of deception and strategy. The Doctor's efforts to thwart the Daleks culminate in the revival of Davros. His return poses a significant threat to the balance of power as both factions vie for dominance. Ultimately, through clever tactics and teamwork, the Doctor and Romana thwart the Daleks' plans, leading to a conclusion that sets the stage for future adventures.
