## Plot Summary
"The Power of Kroll" is set on the third moon of the human colony world Delta Magna, where the Fourth Doctor and Romana search for the fifth segment of the Key to Time. They discover that a methane-catalyzing refinery has upset the natural balance of the swampy environment, awakening a giant squid called Kroll, which has grown in size after ingesting the fifth segment of the Key to Time.

As Kroll surfaces, it wreaks havoc across the moon, escalating tensions between the refinery's crew and the indigenous Swampies, who believe their waters have been disturbed and seek to appease Kroll through sacrifice. The Doctor must navigate these conflicts, understand Kroll's nature, and secure the fifth segment of the Key to Time amidst the rising chaos.
