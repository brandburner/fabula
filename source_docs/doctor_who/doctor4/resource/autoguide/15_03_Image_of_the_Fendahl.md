## Plot Summary
In a priory near the village of Fetchborough, four scientists—Adam Colby, Max Stael, Thea Ransome, and Dr. Fendelman—are conducting tests on a human skull they unearthed in Kenya, claimed to be twelve million years old. When Dr. Fendelman initiates a sonic time scan to get an image of the skull’s owner, the skull reacts, locking onto Thea and releasing something on the priory grounds that kills a passing hiker, who ultimately disintegrates.

The Fourth Doctor and his companion Leela are drawn to the priory by the scan. They discover that the skull is the key to awakening a powerful alien entity known as the Fendahl. The cultist Max Stael is preparing Thea to be transformed and possessed by the Fendahl, which feeds on life and thought. As the Doctor and Leela unravel the mystery, they must confront the looming threat of the Fendahl, who intends to gain full form and wreak havoc.
