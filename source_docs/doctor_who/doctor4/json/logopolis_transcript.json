His words are muffled by the nearby traffic noises. He has propped his bicycle up against the box and is just dropping his rubbish in a nearby bin when the police box whibbles, and his connection is interrupted. It sounds as if a Tardis has just materialised in the police box. As the policeman tries to re- establish communications, the door opens and he is dragged inside. There is the sound of evil laughter."
