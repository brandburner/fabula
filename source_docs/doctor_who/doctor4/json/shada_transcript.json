Very Alien. A monitor starts counting down in roman numerals, from XXX. One of the men is  Christopher Neame, who is dressed slightly differently from the others, and has a nasty scar down his right cheek. When the countdown finishes, his eyes open. Another count begins, this time going upwards. The other five men start jerking in their seats while our man gets up and goes to a wall panel, where he presses some buttons. The countdown reverses back up to XXX. The men stop jerking, and voices begin whispering. Eventually they become still. Our man walks to a control console and flicks some more switches. A male voice comes from the speakers."
