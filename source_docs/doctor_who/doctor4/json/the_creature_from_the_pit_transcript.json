On one side is a rope winch. Two of the group hold a man by his arms, and two women look down into the pit then raise their arms. A man produces an enormous horn, almost as big as himself, and blows, while the prisoner falls to his knees and clasps his hands, whimpering. Below ground, something growls. The younger woman nods, and the prisoner is pushed into the pit."
