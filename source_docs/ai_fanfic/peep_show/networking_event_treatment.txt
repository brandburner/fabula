Peep Show
"The Networking Event"

Mark Corrigan's bedroom in Apollo House, Croydon, had become a shrine to corporate anxiety. His IKEA Markus chair, purchased during what he called his "New Year, New Office" phase (a desperate attempt to seem more professional during Zoom calls), creaked ominously as he leaned forward to refresh LinkedIn for the seventeenth time that morning. His MetricShift Digital "Employee of the Month (August 2023)" certificate hung askew next to his University of Dartmouth Business Studies diploma, both gathering dust like his chances of ever making it to Senior Regional Manager.

The HP laptop's screen glowed with Steve Benson's latest "humbled to announce" post. Steve from accounts, the man who had once asked Mark how to convert a Word document to PDF and tried to expense a Nando's loyalty card, was now officially a "Digital Transformation Specialist" with a Microsoft Excel certification. Mark's "Career Crisis Management" spreadsheet, open in another tab, showed a disturbing downward trend in his quarterly "Perceived Value Add" metrics.

"The digital revolution is eating its children," Mark thought, straightening his TM Lewin shirt while still wearing his M&S boxers - his standard work-from-home compromise between professionalism and comfort. "And somehow Steve from accounts is becoming the digital Marie Antoinette."

The sound of experimental electronic music mixed with what might have been Buddhist chants (or possibly a malfunctioning printer) drifted through the wall from Jeremy Usbourne's room. Jeremy, whose CV listed his occupation as "Sonic Visionary/Consciousness Optimizer" after the collapse of his band "Momentary Enlightenment" and their failed residency at the Croydon Buddhist Centre, had been practicing his pitch for the MetricShift Innovation Sundowner event all morning.

"Mark! Mark! The corporate world won't know what hit it!" Jeremy burst in wearing Mark's old M&S interview suit, the one reserved for career emergencies and stored in a box marked "Career Emergency Kit - Do Not Touch Under Any Circumstances." The suit, like everything about Jeremy's attempt at professionalism, was slightly wrong - the tie was too short, the jacket smelled faintly of weed, and he'd accessorized it with festival wristbands from Glastonbury 2019 and a "Web3 Visionary" pin badge from his failed NFT marketplace for meditation sounds.

In their living room, surrounded by empty Red Bull cans and printouts of Gary Vaynerchuk quotes he'd highlighted at 3 AM, Jeremy practiced his pitch in front of a cracked mirror salvaged from his former yoga-rave startup "Downward Digital." The mirror, like most of Jeremy's possessions, had been acquired through what he called "entrepreneurial appropriation" from a closing business.

"I'm a disruptor in the sonic arts space," Jeremy rehearsed, adjusting Mark's tie with the confidence of someone who had watched three YouTube videos about tie-knotting. "Leveraging unique audio paradigms to create transformative experiences. Former projects include the critically acclaimed 'Sounds of the Serviced Office' EP."

Mark, anxiously reorganizing his "Networking Emergency Protocols" index cards (color-coded by severity of social disaster), watched in horror. The EP Jeremy referred to was actually just recordings of the office printer at his uncle's accounting firm, captured while Jeremy was experimenting with ketamine and convinced the printer was "speaking the language of late capitalism."

At MetricShift Digital Solutions' Canary Wharf headquarters, the 14th floor "Ideation Zone" had been transformed for the monthly Innovation Sundowner. Charlotte Walsh-Henderson, Head of Digital Transformation and veteran of three Silicon Valley burnouts, supervised the arrangement of kombucha stations with the intensity of someone who had replaced coffee with mindfulness apps. Her journey from Stanford MBA to MetricShift had involved three failed startups, a brief period living in an ashram, and what she called her "quantum leap into corporate enlightenment."

Mark lurked by the fruit-infused water station, straightening his LinkedIn Premium name badge and calculating the optimal moment to introduce Jeremy without destroying his own career. His corner of the open-plan office had been shrinking with each "space optimization initiative," but his job titles kept getting longer - he was now officially a "Regional Digital Transformation Strategy Implementation Manager," which mainly involved making sure people filled in their timesheets correctly.

When Jeremy met Charlotte, Mark watched in horror as his worlds collided. Jeremy's pitch about "using sound frequencies to optimize workplace productivity" was based entirely on his experience of listening to The Chemical Brothers while trying to assemble an IKEA bookshelf, but Charlotte was captivated. She'd been looking for innovative solutions since the Great Algorithm Crisis of '23, when MetricShift's AI chatbot had achieved sentience for six hours and approved everyone's annual leave requests.

A week later, in MetricShift's executive boardroom (rebranded as "The Disruption Chamber" after a Â£50,000 consulting project), Jeremy set up his DJ equipment. The gear, borrowed from his former bandmate Super Hans' silent disco business "Quiet Riot," had seen better days - possibly in the late 1990s. Alan Johnson, CEO of Johnson Dynamic Solutions and potential MetricShift merger partner, watched with unexpected interest as Jeremy prepared to demonstrate his "scientifically-engineered productivity soundscape."

Mark, trying to blend into the Herman Miller wallpaper (another costly rebranding decision), contemplated his career options. "Jeremy's going to get a corporate job before me," he thought. "I'm going to end up working in his sonic optimization department, reporting to someone who once tried to make tea in a toaster. Maybe this is karma for all those times I told people I was 'circling back' when I had no intention of circling anywhere."

The presentation was exactly as chaotic as Mark feared. Jeremy, running on three Red Bulls and misplaced confidence, had created his "productivity soundscape" by layering his old acid house tracks over a free meditation app, occasionally whispering "synergy" and "workflow" into the mix. But Johnson loved it. "This is exactly what we need," he announced, as Mark contemplated whether it was too late to join the French Foreign Legion. "Raw, disruptive, authentically digital."

Back at the Apollo House flat, Super Hans had already set up what he called his "blockchain command center" on the kitchen table - a battered laptop displaying the remains of his hacked cryptocurrency project 'MindCoin,' surrounded by printouts about blockchain and meditation apps. His eyes had the manic gleam of someone who'd been coding on ketamine for 48 hours straight.

"This is it, Jez," Super Hans declared, somehow having acquired both a MetricShift lanyard and what appeared to be a Silicon Valley startup branded hoodie. "This is the big one. We combine your corporate sound therapy thing with what's left of my mindfulness platform. Call it 'SonicChain.' The suits'll love it."

Jeremy, high on corporate success and possibly several other things, was already onboard. "Hans, you're a genius. We could add NFTs somehow. Like, people buy the right to different frequency ranges."

"Already on it, my friend," Super Hans replied, typing furiously on his laptop with the confidence of someone who'd learned coding from a YouTube video titled 'Blockchain for Beginners (WARNING: INTENSE)'. "Been coding since Tuesday. Well, since Tuesday's ketamine wore off. The Russians might've nicked my database, but they can't steal the vision."

Mark, still wearing his MetricShift lanyard like a noose of corporate shame, entered to find his kitchen had become a tech incubator for the clinically delusional. "Oh good, Super Hans is here. I suppose you'll be wanting to pitch your crypto-mindfulness app to MetricShift as well?"

"Mark, Mark, Mark," Super Hans shook his head with the patience of a dissolute guru. "Think bigger. What's the one thing missing from corporate meditation? Exactly - the blockchain. That, and proper drugs. But we'll sort that out in phase two."

Mark could already see it coming - Super Hans would end up on the board of directors, probably after convincing Charlotte that his ketamine-fueled coding sessions were actually "quantum pair programming." This was how the financial crisis started.

Later that evening, in The Fox & Goose pub on Croydon High Street, Mark nursed a warm white wine while Jeremy celebrated with Super Hans, who had somehow acquired a MetricShift lanyard and was already talking about integrating his crypto-mindfulness app (before it got hacked by the Russians) with Jeremy's sonic optimization platform.

Mark's phone buzzed - a LinkedIn notification showed that Steve from accounts had endorsed Jeremy for "Digital Transformation" and "Change Management." Jeremy, who had once tried to start a cryptocurrency based on the sound of his own meditation breathing, was now officially more employable than Mark.

"I need another drink," Mark muttered, wondering if this was how the dinosaurs felt watching the mammals take over - confused, obsolete, and seriously considering a career change. His "Career Crisis Management" spreadsheet would need a new tab for "Existential Corporate Dread."
