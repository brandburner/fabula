Peep Show
"The Networking Event"

Mark Corrigan, perpetually trapped between ambition and anxiety, stares at his laptop screen in his Peckham flat at precisely 7:13 AM. His recent promotion to Regional Sales Manager at MetricShift Digital Solutions (formerly DataDyne Analytics until the hostile takeover of 2022) feels increasingly precarious. The company has gone through three restructures in eight months, each one leaving him somehow simultaneously more senior and more expendable. His corner of the open plan office in Canary Wharf keeps getting smaller, but his job title keeps getting longer. The crooked "Digital Transformation Champion Q3 2023" certificate on his wall feels like a participation trophy in a race he's already losing.

"God, everyone's getting certifications," he thinks, scrolling past posts from former colleagues. Steven Benson from accounts, graduate of the University of North London's night school program, now calls himself a "Digital Transformation Guru" despite once setting the office microwave on fire trying to heat up a Fray Bentos pie still in its tin. Mark had to handle the incident report, which somehow ended up being mentioned in his annual review by former supervisor David Mitchell-Stephens (now leading "innovation strategies" at their main competitor, Apex Solutions).

In the living room, Jeremy Usbourne - failed musician, occasional DJ, and perpetual "between projects" creative - lies on their depreciated DFS sofa surrounded by empty Monster Energy cans. The former frontman of "Momentary Enlightenment" (whose only gig at the Croydon Buddhist Center ended in an incense-related evacuation) is practicing his "elevator pitch" for the networking event. Mark reluctantly agreed to bring him after three days of psychological warfare involving loud experimental music at 3 AM and passive-aggressive notes about the electricity bill Mark "selfishly runs up with his LinkedIn Premium addiction."

The suit Jeremy's "borrowed" from Mark's "Career Emergency Kit" box once represented everything Mark aspired to be. Purchased from Marks & Spencer during the 2009 summer sale, it had seen him through eight successful interviews and one very awkward funeral (for Regional Director Sandra Pickering's goldfish - a story that still circulates in MetricShift's Slack channels). Now, like everything Jeremy touches, it's become part of an elaborate performance art piece about corporate authenticity, accessorized with festival wristbands from Glastonbury 2019 and a suspicious stain that might be from his failed "audio-reactive kombucha startup" venture with former bandmate Sebastian "Super Hans" Hanson.

At MetricShift's monthly "Innovation Sundowner" - a phrase that makes Mark die a little inside every time he has to say it - the 14th floor "Ideation Zone" has been transformed with motivational posters and kombucha stations. Charlotte Walsh-Henderson, Mark's new boss and a recent import from MetricShift's Seattle office (after three documented Silicon Valley burnouts and a meditation retreat in Big Sur), seems particularly intrigued by Jeremy's confident nonsense. She represents everything Mark both desires and resents about modern corporate culture - she has an MBA from Stanford but speaks in TikTok references, breaks up endless Zoom meetings with "mindfulness breaks," and once suggested they should "manifest their Q4 targets through interpretive dance."

Alan Johnson, CEO of Johnson Dynamic Solutions and potential merger partner (known in industry circles as "The Disruptor Whisperer" after successfully pivoting six failing startups into moderately successful crypto schemes), watches with unexpected interest as Jeremy sets up his borrowed DJ equipment in the executive boardroom - known internally as "The Disruption Chamber" since Charlotte's controversial rebranding initiative.

The borrowed equipment itself tells a story - salvaged from Super Hans' failed "Silent Disco Solutions Ltd." venture (which ended in three noise complaints and one restraining order from the Vauxhall Business Center). Jeremy plans to use it to transform his old acid house tracks, originally recorded under the name "Digital Prophet" during his brief collaboration with underground DJ collective "The Hoxton Shamans," into what he's calling "scientifically-engineered productivity soundscapes."

Mark hovers anxiously by the fruit-infused water station (installed during MetricShift's "Wellness Revolution" initiative of 2023, which also saw the ill-fated introduction of mandatory desk yoga led by Sarah Jenkins from HR, now pursuing her "authentic path" as a digital nomad in Bali). He watches Jeremy work the room with unexpected success, deploying buzzwords he's gathered from three TED talks and what Mark suspects is an illegally downloaded copy of "Disruption Mindset: The Gary Vaynerchuk Method."

"He's like a virus that's learned to mimic normal human behavior," Mark thinks, watching Jeremy charm Melissa Chakrabarti, MetricShift's Head of Innovation Strategies and former founding member of three failed meditation app startups. "They actually seem to be buying his made-up startup nonsense about 'sonic disruption.' This must be how the Romans felt watching the barbarians learn to use their own weapons against them."

The situation takes an unexpected turn when Jeremy meets Charlotte properly. She's immediately captivated by his pitch about "using sound frequencies to optimize workplace productivity" - a concept Jeremy has invented on the spot based on his experience of listening to The Chemical Brothers while trying to assemble an IKEA BILLY bookcase. The fact that the bookcase collapsed during a particularly aggressive bass drop has been consciously omitted from his pitch deck.

Mark watches in horror as Jeremy gets invited to demo his "technology" at next week's leadership offsite, where Alan Johnson will be present along with representatives from venture capital firm Quantum Horizons (whose managing partner Richard "Ricky" Thompson-Smith once rejected Mark's careful 46-slide presentation about optimizing the office printer network in favor of funding a company that makes AI-powered toe socks).

"This is how it ends," Mark thinks as Jeremy enthusiastically accepts, already planning to pass off his old drug-fueled electronica tracks as "scientifically-engineered productivity soundscapes." "Not with a bang, but with my flatmate playing his awful electronic music to the entire senior management team. I wonder if there are any jobs going at Pret? I could work my way up to sandwich artisan, live a simple life of honest toil..."

The offsite presentation unfolds in MetricShift's glass-walled conference room, recently renamed "The Visionary Vista" as part of Charlotte's ongoing "Spatial Empowerment Initiative." Jeremy, running on three Red Bulls and misplaced confidence, sets up his ancient DJ equipment while the entire senior management team watches. Among them sits Barbara Chen-Martinez, MetricShift's veteran CFO who survived both the Great Algorithm Crisis of '23 and the infamous "Casual Friday Incident" that no one in Accounts will talk about.

Jeremy's "productivity soundscape" - actually his old acid house track "Quantum Enlightenment" layered over a free meditation app, with occasional whispered mantras about "synergy" and "workflow optimization" - fills the room. Mark contemplates whether it's too late to join the French Foreign Legion, or possibly pursue his backup career plan of becoming a tour guide at the Bank of England Museum.

But in a twist that confirms Mark's worst suspicions about corporate life, Johnson loves it. "This is exactly the kind of disruptive thinking we need," he announces, as Mark calculates how many years it would take to pay off his student loans on a tour guide's salary. "It's authentic, it's raw, it's exactly what we've been looking for."

Mark watches in despair as Jeremy is offered a contract to develop his "sonic optimization platform" for Johnson's entire organization, which includes subsidiaries in three countries and a recently acquired "digital wellness consultancy" run by Mark's ex-girlfriend Sophie Chapman (who left him for a cryptocurrency evangelist in 2021). "Jeremy's going to get a corporate job before me," he thinks. "I'm going to end up working in his sonic optimization department, reporting to someone who once tried to make tea in a toaster. Maybe this is karma for all those times I told people I was 'circling back' when I had no intention of circling anywhere."

The story concludes with Jeremy planning to expand his "sonic consultancy" while Mark updates his LinkedIn profile to include "Thought Leadership" among his skills, having finally accepted that in modern corporate life, the appearance of competence trumps actual competence every time. "After all," he thinks, staring at his reflection in his ergonomic desk mirror (purchased during MetricShift's "Personal Brand Enhancement" month), "if Jeremy can become a business guru, maybe I can finally start putting 'ninja' in my job title without feeling physically sick."

Meanwhile, in the office kitchen, Super Hans is already pitching Charlotte on his new startup idea: "Blockchain-enabled mindfulness for pets." Mark's quiet sobbing can be heard through the newly installed acoustic optimization panels.
